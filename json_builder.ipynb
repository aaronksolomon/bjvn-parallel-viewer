       " 3: 'Now, to introduce the story of Unification is to indirectly acknowledge that there is still something that remains ununified, or if unified, it is not yet complete.\\n\\nIndeed, it is so.\\n\\nIs it necessary to unify Vietnamese Buddhism? Among us Buddhists, who would not feel a twinge of shame upon hearing this question? Being disciples of the Buddha, those who pride themselves on living within the spirit of great compassion and respect of the supreme teachings, yet we have often struggled and faced difficulties with the issue of unification.\\n\\nIn truth, for Buddhism, this matter of unification should not even be an issue.\\n\\nFor Buddhists, unification should not be a challenging matter.\\n\\nYet, to this day, we still find ourselves discussing unification, and moreover, we must continue to tirelessly build upon the foundation of unity.',\n",
       " 4: 'Is it perhaps because we lack the talent? Or because we lack the spirit of harmony? Or is it that we are not very passionate about the work of unification?\\n\\nIn the declaration of the establishment of the General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism, announced in 1951, the Buddhist delegates nationwide earnestly called:\\n\\n\"Oh, all Vietnamese Buddhists, let us level the differences, unite in heart and mind to fulfill the mission of creating peace, sowing the seeds of joy, and raising high the torch of wisdom of the Blessed One.\"\\n\\nThe echo of that heartfelt call still resonates in our souls. The foundation has been laid. Buddhists nationwide joyfully welcomed the day of Unified Buddhism. The unification movement gained strength, and everywhere, the resounding songs of young Buddhists praised that great endeavor of unity:\\n\\n\"Vietnamese Buddhism unifies North, South, Central from now on.\\n\\nWith one heart, we advance for the sacred path!\\n\\nLet us rejoice in the radiant golden light of the Dharma, shining in all directions.\\n\\nResounding songs welcome Vietnamese Buddhism...\"\\n\\nThe Buddhist community has passionately embraced the unification movement, yearning for unification, demanding unification.\\n\\nThat alone is enough to prove that the work of unification can indeed be fully realized. The Buddhist masses have never harbored distinctions between one Buddhist organization and another. Consider the event of the Relic Procession years ago in the capital, which stands as compelling evidence; all the various Buddhist organizations in the South joined forces to organize a grand and solemn ceremony. A sea of people with tens of thousands of Buddhist flags created an unprecedented jubilant atmosphere in the capital, and Dr. Malalasekera, president of the world Buddhist organization, did not withhold words of praise upon witnessing the spectacle.\\n\\nThus, we cannot say that Vietnamese Buddhists lack the spirit of harmony, nor can we say that we are not very passionate about the work of unification.\\n\\nSo why is it that, to this day, besides the General Association, there are still other groups operating independently?\\n\\nClearly, it is due to a lack of mutual understanding and knowledge among the Buddhist groups within and outside the General Association. The six groups within the General Association of Buddhism, during the second congress in the capital Saigon, outlined a program of unification...',\n",
       " 5: 'Buddhists, have contributed to the collective construction\\n\\nproviding a firm foundation for Vietnamese Buddhism. The\\n\\nmonks and lay practitioners leading the Buddhist organizations within the General\\n\\nAssociation have shown great enthusiasm. Yet, the atmosphere of the capital at the\\n\\nsecond congress was perhaps not as vibrant as the people\\'s hopes,\\n\\nbecause there remained many other Buddhist groups\\n\\nobserving the congress with an objective, almost\\n\\ncool demeanor.\\n\\nThe General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism must open its arms wide to invite\\n\\nfellow Buddhist groups. The General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism must\\n\\nbe the great family of all Vietnamese Buddhists. In reality,\\n\\nto achieve this modern unity, the groups within the General Association must first\\n\\ndemonstrate deep understanding and must always avoid anything that could\\n\\ncause misunderstanding or harm the foundation of unity. The groups outside the General Association,\\n\\namong them the original Buddhist group, must also\\n\\nacknowledge that the realization of \"harmony\" is the most urgent and\\n\\nimportant task in the current stage. Buddhism is the force\\n\\nof Peace. The General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism is our communal body.\\n\\nIn the harmonious symphony of unity, let us offer ourselves as a harmonious sound.\\n\\nIn building the unified Buddhist house, let us transform ourselves into a foundational stone.\\n\\nOne day, the individual identities of all groups will be erased,\\n\\nand we will only see one unified and great community: that\\n\\nis - Unified Vietnamese Buddhism.\\n\\nO leaders of Buddhist groups within and outside the General Association!

G.\\n\\nMillions of eyes are focused on you.\\n\\nProve yourselves worthy as enlightened leaders\\n\\nso as not to let down the hopes of all our Vietnamese Buddhists.\\n\\nIs Buddhism\\n\\na religion or not? Many have asked this question, considering it\\n\\nimportant. In truth,\\n\\nthis question is not very important.\\n\\nWhether we call Buddhism\\n\\na religion, a philosophy,\\n\\nor even a science,\\n\\nBuddhism remains Buddhism,\\n\\nunchanged.\\n\\nBefore me is a Buddhist dictionary.\\n\\nI say: I see the dictionary. If someone asks\\n\\nhow I can see the dictionary, I will answer that\\n\\nI have eyes.\\n\\n• Because I have eyes * this answer is correct, not wrong. But\\n\\nto say it is wholly correct is insufficient, because\\n\\nbesides the eyes, many other conditions are needed:\\n\\nlight, space,\\n\\nvisual consciousness, mental consciousness, etc.\\n\\nThus, stating that Buddhism is\\n\\na religion, or stating that * Buddhism\\n\\nis a philosophy, are both correct.\\n\\nBut not entirely correct. The reason is\\n\\nwhen we speak thus, we are only viewing one\\n\\naspect of Buddhism.\\n\\nHowever, even standing on the aspect\\n\\nof belief, we can examine and determine whether Buddhism\\n\\nis compatible with the spirit of democracy.\\n\\nThe thought of Auguste Comte can\\n\\nrepresent the philosophical thought of the late nineteenth and\\n\\nearly twentieth centuries before the\\n\\nEuropean wars. Comte affirmed the\\n\\nprogressive nature of human thought, and\\n\\nbased on that, he divided the history\\n\\nof human thought into three periods:\\n\\nThe period of religion, that\\n\\nis the ancient period.\\nThe period of philosophy, from the\\n\\nbeginning of the sixteenth century to the beginning of the\\n\\nnineteenth century.\\nThe period of science, from\\n\\nthe nineteenth century onwards.\\n\\nThe period of religion is the period of superstition.\\n\\nThe period of philosophy is the period of idealism.\\n\\nThe period of science is the period of empirical\\n\\nexperiment. This is roughly Comte\\'s categorization.\\n\\nWe see this categorization\\n\\nas still ambiguous and not without errors.\\n\\nTo claim religion, philosophy, and\\n\\nscience represent three periods\\n\\nis quite an awkward endeavor. Humanity in the first period\\n\\n—the period of religion, according to Comte—\\n\\ndid they not have philosophical and scientific thoughts?\\n\\nHumanity in the second period—the period of philosophy—\\n\\ndid they not have religious and philosophical thoughts?\\n\\nThus, this categorization\\n\\nis somewhat mechanical, and this\\n\\nis the major error of the French philosopher.\\n\\nReligion, philosophy, and science are\\n\\nconcrete manifestations of human thought. Each has its own\\n\\nprogressive trajectory, its own origin.\\n\\nAuguste Comte only saw\\n\\nthat these three have dynamics, evolution,\\n\\nbut he could not see\\n\\ntheir true nature.\\n\\nIn ancient times, religious thought\\n\\nwas still immature and naive; during this period,\\n\\nthere arose both immature philosophical reasoning, erroneous and\\n\\nnot concrete. At the same time,\\n\\nscience also emerged: developing tools, utensils for practical human usage,\\n\\nharnessing water power to pound rice, discovering fire...\\n\\nall are initial achievements of science. Although these\\n\\nare not the ages of airplanes, cannons, and atoms,\\n\\nwithout the naïve and rudimentary stages, there would be no age of mature\\n\\nsophistication.\\n\\nFrom the nineteenth century to the present, science\\n\\nhas advanced rapidly and remarkably: philosophy and religion\\n\\nhave followed and made progress. Currently, Western philosophy,\\n\\ndue to new influences,\\n\\nhas begun to be constructed on a scientific foundation,\\n\\nand has resolved many new issues.\\n\\nReligion has the aspiration to resolve\\n\\nthe origins of the universe and human life,\\n\\nbut it always needs faith\\n\\nfirst and foremost. Philosophy also seeks to have\\n\\na comprehensive vision like religion,\\n\\nbut desires to be impartial. Science,\\n\\nin turn, is a detailed examination.\\n\\nNot building upon faith,\\n\\nphilosophy must continually rely\\n\\non experimentation to find a firm\\n\\nstand. Therefore, philosophy\\n\\nplays the role of synthesis, it is the result\\n\\nof harmonizing both science and religion.\\n\\nThus, philosophy has denounced\\n\\nmisguided superstitious religions and supported\\n\\ngenuine religions, suitable with the level\\n\\nof civilization of contemporary society.\\n\\nStanding between religion and science, sometimes\\n\\nphilosophy explains things\\n\\nthat science has not yet comprehended. Though\\n\\nstill within the realm of ideals,\\n\\nsuch things could be future discoveries\\n\\nof empirical science.\\n\\nThrough the investigation of beliefs\\n\\nand guiding discoveries,\\n\\nphilosophy is also called a stimulating factor\\n\\nfor religion and science.\\n\\nThe welfare of society depends greatly\\n\\non human concepts of all three\\n\\naspects: religion, science,\\n\\nand philosophy. Many people do not understand\\n\\nthis, yet believe that society only\\n\\nneeds empirical science.\\n\\nThis bias is a consequence of\\n\\nthe influence of Comte\\'s three-stage theory.\\n\\nBelieving that religion is a representative\\n\\nof human thought in ancient times,\\n\\nunsuitable for today\\'s civilized world,\\n\\nmany advocate\\n\\nthat religion is unnecessary. Some\\n\\npolitical parties even call for\\n\\n\"down with religion,\" creating\\n\\na movement within a chaotic society.\\n\\nIn truth, humanity cannot\\n\\nexist without belief. Reviewing\\n\\nhistory, we see that religion is indeed\\n\\nthe foundation of social cohesion.\\n\\nThe Islamic nation has forbidden its\\n\\npeople from believing in any religion\\n\\nother than Islam, simultaneously\\n\\nusing political power to conquer weaker neighbors. The Communist Party\\n\\nonly trusts in one - the \"unique\" communist ideology, believing firmly\\n\\nin this ideology as if in divinity.\\n\\nUnder the red flag, the center of cohesion\\n\\nis the ideology of Karl Marx. Relying\\n\\non that ideology to mobilize, to\\n\\nconcentrate the thoughts and will of the people, to\\n\\ncomplete the form of\\n\\ncommunist party rule, is akin to promoting a kind\\n\\nof religion: communist religion. Thus,\\n\\nparty society or communist party, even if calling for the downfall\\n\\nof religion, merely seeks to overthrow old religions,\\n\\nto establish a \"new religion\" of their own.\\n\\nUltimately, belief remains\\n\\nvery necessary for the cohesion\\n\\nof society.\\n\\nThus, we have seen the extremely\\n\\nimportant position of belief in\\n\\nconstructing a new society. An erroneous\\n\\nbelief system can create an\\n\\nautocratic society, can lead people\\n\\nto a path of conquest,\\n\\ncausing unwholesome karma. A genuine\\n\\nbelief foundation is needed for people\\n\\nto truly achieve\\n\\ngreat cohesion, a powerful social force,\\n\\nnot directing humanity towards autocracy,\\n\\noppression, conquest.\\n\\nThe cohesive force of humanity\\n\\n—social nature—hence is very necessary\\n\\nfor humanity, but the most concrete and complete\\n\\norganizational condition of society is still the nation.\\n\\nEach nation can be a unit for that\\n\\ngreat cohesive force. Every nation has\\n\\na belief in the universe (cosmology)\\n\\nto serve as the backdrop for its unique\\n\\nview of humanity. Relying\\n\\non cosmic belief, people have\\n\\na human view which is\\n\\nan imitation of the natural world to\\n\\norganize human relations. The ancient\\n\\npolitics of China took the phrase \"following heaven and\\n\\nobserving earth,\" as its foundation for that reason.\\n\\nSociety\\'s customs, religion\\n\\nare all dependent upon the conditions\\n\\nof belief in that cosmology, and\\n\\nhence, the foundation of the nation\\n\\ncan be stable.\\n\\nTherefore, reflection on this,\\n\\nwe see that belief in a cosmology is the point\\n\\nof concentration of thought and will of a nation.\\n\\nNow, discussing the democratic regime,\\n\\nis to speak of a form\\n\\nof political society. Let us examine\\n\\nhow religion relates to social\\n\\nand political organization, then determine\\n\\nwhether Buddhism is compatible\\n\\nwith the spirit of democracy.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the relationship\\n\\nbetween religion and politics, history\\n\\nof humanity can be divided into three\\n\\nperiods:\\n\\nFirst is the ancient period. This\\n\\nis the age of polytheism. In those times,\\n\\nhuman intellect was still naive,\\n\\nthus in all activities, people always\\n\\nfelt threatened by nature. Hence, humanity\\n\\ndeveloped fear of nature, believing each\\n\\nphenomenon in the universe was governed by\\n\\na divine being: god of wind,\\n\\ngod of rain, god of thunder, god of lightning, god\\n\\nof mountains, god of rivers...\\n\\nFear then led to veneration,\\n\\nbelief, and supplication. Therefore,\\n\\nthat period is called the age of polytheism.\\nAt that time, humans lived in\\n\\ntribes, each tribe led by a\\n\\nchieftain. That political system naturally took\\n\\nthe cosmology of polytheism as its backdrop.\\nHuman intellect gradually expanded.\\n\\nFrom polytheistic belief, humanity advanced to\\n\\nmonotheistic belief, believing that the universe\\n\\nand humanity were created by a supreme\\n\\ndivine being. Though the phenomena of the universe\\n\\nwere diverse and complex, they were all\\n\\nproduced by a single divine.\\n\\nThis is the period of monotheism.\\n\\nPolitics in that era was\\n\\norganized in the form of monarchy.\\n\\nDue to monotheistic cosmology,\\n\\nmonarchical theocratic autocratic forms arose.',\n",
       " 10: 'In the contemporary era, human consciousness has advanced rapidly. People have become aware of their own value and rights, leading to collective movements to abolish the monarchy and establish a system of egalitarian democracy. People have gradually realized that the success or failure, prosperity or decline of a nation does not rest in the hands of a king, but in the hands of the entire populace. Each individual, in relation to society and the supreme organization of the nation, must have equivalent duties and enjoy equivalent rights.\\n\\nThe center of unity is where each individual recognizes their duty as a citizen in a democratic nation, comprehends what democracy entails, and practices according to democratic principles. Duties and rights are shared and enjoyed without class distinction, completely equal. The central point is the community spirit of the people. In other words, each individual is a central point.\\n\\nDuring the period when civil rights are expanding, polytheistic and monotheistic beliefs are no longer suitable and naturally cannot sustain themselves. There must be a classless religion, a religion where the truth of equality is promulgated, a religion that affirms the creative and constructive value of each person — to serve as the focal point for the faith of the entire populace, and to be the foundation for the development of individuality and community traits.\\n\\nHere, only Buddhism is worthy.\\n\\nBuddhist philosophy also proposes a cosmology: overthrowing the superstitious cosmology of monotheism and polytheism to establish a cosmology based on interdependent origination.\\n\\nInterdependent origination means the events of mutual relation, mutual causation, and mutual formation. Whether the universe, society, and humanity are good or bad, all are the result of human actions. The bodily, verbal, and mental actions of individuals collectively create a universe, a society. The driving force behind all success, failure, merit, and demerit, good and bad, lies in the individual and collective karma of all beings.\\n\\nThis belief in a cosmology of interdependent origination and collective karma is very suitable with the current social concept of equality. Here, humans are not to submit to deities, but rather see themselves as fully responsible for their own happiness. Such a genuine belief, affirming the value of human duties and rights so firmly, is indeed very fitting with human aspirations and abilities, and ultimately, can serve as the foundation for building a truly democratic society, respecting equality and freedom.\\n\\nA nation that adopts the belief in a cosmology of interdependent origination and collective karma as its backdrop can achieve profound unity and can build a humanistic and virtuous national culture.\\n\\nTherefore, we conclude that Buddhism is the belief that serves as the foundation for building a democratic society.\\n\\nD. T.\\n\\nVietnamese Buddhism',\n",
       " 11: 'Article by Minh Hạnh\\n\\nIn society, there are two types of people who do not see themselves truly living: those who are extremely poor and those who roll themselves along the slope of desires. The first type toils throughout the year in the struggle for survival, leaving no time to contemplate the meaning of life. Material deprivation exhausts them, leaving them no free moment. They pour all their thoughts into work, worry, and sorrow due to failure and suffering, and they hardly ever question the meaning of life. Though they might occasionally pause to suddenly realize that life is suffering, thinking that living is to endure pain, such thoughts merely flicker in their minds and then sink into their subconscious. Reality awaits them: where is the time to endlessly ponder the value of life! Thus, they return to work, and until the last moment of their lives, they live and operate like machines, obeying some external, mysterious force.\\n\\nThe second type obeys the call of sensual pleasures daily, immersing themselves in bodily delights, thereby forgetting they are living within a human society. These people, naturally, must possess considerable wealth, whether inherited from parents or obtained through unethical means. Perhaps some among this group intentionally forget life. Why do they wish to forget life? This is easily understood. They have not comprehended life, seen the true value of existence, to claim they have forgotten it! Forgetting life here is just a guise for the bankruptcy of conscience, a statement to cover all that is most vile and rotten in humanity. Forgetting life means wanting no more connection with the world, yet the means used to forget life — money — are still deceitfully exploited within life itself!\\n\\nThe first type deserves our sympathy, if not our compassion. The second type initially evokes our aversion, but in truth, they are even more deserving of pity. Two opposing circumstances sharing the same fate: they are the least living, for they rarely realize they are alive; in other words, they seldom question the true value of life.\\n\\nBut fortunately, these people are few. Let no one be so pessimistic as to believe that all laborers are in the dire situations depicted in *Mother Lê\\'s House* by Thạch Lam or *The Workers Going to Work* by Lan Khai. No! Our country\\'s so-called \"realist\" writers have pushed our imagination too far from reality!\\n\\nLikewise, let no one be so pessimistic as to believe that the moths attracted to the flame of decadence can pollute the current society. We, who are fortunate enough to have a little time to ponder life, recognize that humans cannot live indifferently like plants. We cannot let life drift by with merely eating, sleeping, sleeping, and eating. We must seek something higher than mere sustenance. This tendency to \"seek\" is inherent in us and often keeps us in constant questioning.\\n\\nSometimes, looking up at the vast sky, vast rivers and mountains, and then back at ourselves, we are moved to ask: why is the sky so deep? Why do countless stars twinkle? Where did those mountains and rivers come from? What is our body? Why were we born here? Where do we come from and where will we go?\\n\\nIn the infinite space and endless time, we feel small and strangely pitiful. We long to understand these perplexing questions. Many questions leave us speechless before the vast universe. We suffer because of our questioning, our desire to understand. We suffer, yet we find that we need to suffer in this way; for this suffering gives us a profound and expansive understanding of our life.',\n",
       " 12: 'A poet, Thế Lữ, after traversing many memories and loves entangled in the ephemeral life, one day suddenly finds himself before the infinitely vast scene:\\n\\nThe sun gradually sets\\n\\nHigh in the sky, clouds drift leisurely\\n\\nA distant boat, sails upright, stands still,\\n\\nThe sea surface as smooth as a gray silk screen.\\n\\nThe wet beach, reflecting the bright sky,\\n\\nI step up, a person in the void,\\n\\nHearing the faint sound of the wind,\\n\\nThe whispering of the silent pines,\\n\\nWith the waves gently lapping in intervals of silence...\\n\\nBefore such a vast water and sky scene, one suddenly feels alone:\\n\\nI look far and wide, the distant seas,\\n\\nAlone with the vastness in my heart,\\n\\nLike a wanderer dazed,\\n\\nLost in the desolate lands,\\n\\nI carry a somber love,\\n\\nSeeking yet not finding the profound truth in creation.\\n\\nThe poet has shared our concern for the truth of life! The feeling of a wanderer lost in the desolate land, oh, how cold and lonely it is! The poet has longed to understand the profound truth of life, of creation, \"seeking but not finding.\" But how did the poet seek, or was it merely with a heart burdened with memories and sorrows?\\n\\nPaused in dismay, I look at the clouds, at the waters,\\n\\nLook at the blue sky with a solemn face,\\n\\nIn the four directions, the horizon is vague,\\n\\nAnd I ask: where is the truth?\\n\\nThe universe is vast and boundless. And before the poet\\'s eyes, the blue sky, the vast sea, the high clouds... Seeing these phenomena, the poet was bewildered, longing to understand. This longing reached a peak, causing the poet to question, to suffer. How tragic it is, when before the earnest questions of a person longing for truth, the universe remains silent, indifferent, and unfeeling, offering no answer:\\n\\nAsking the profound, boundless, and endless scenes,\\n\\nClouds always flying, waves always lapping, wind never stopping\\n\\nAsking if you hear my voice,\\n\\nHear the voice of a suffering soul?\\n\\nI thirst to know the wondrous truth in the universe:\\n\\nBut alas! creation remains silent,\\n\\nFor thousands of years, keeping an indifferent face,\\n\\nAloof, mysterious, and sublime...\\n\\nThe universe remains silent, unwilling to unveil its mysterious veil. Humans will never find peace in life if their great inner questions are not resolved. Poet Trần Tử Ngang of old, when standing before infinite space and endless time, also felt perplexed and sorrowful, moved to tears:\\n\\nBefore me, no ancient people,\\n\\nBehind me, no future beings;\\n\\nContemplating the vast universe,\\n\\nAlone, I shed tears...\\n\\nA certain poet translated it as follows:\\n\\nWho has passed before?\\n\\nWho has yet to be born?\\n\\nPondering the endless sky and earth,\\n\\nAlone, I shed a tear.\\n\\nOh, how painful! Before us, who were they, and after us, who will they be? Why do we appear in life only to one day disappear, as easily as a drop of water in the vast ocean? The tear of the poet is indeed valuable, worth a thousand gold. It is the tear that springs from a heart filled with deep questioning. A very genuine questioning. Many have cried, and human tears indeed rival the waters of the four great oceans. But most human tears have flowed in the bitterness and suffering of life. How few have been like Trần Tử Ngang, crying for the thirst for truth. That tear truly possesses unparalleled value.\\n\\nIn our souls, impressions of joy and sorrow follow one another through the continuous flow of time. However, joyful moments fade more quickly than sorrows. The deep, lingering sorrow of humanity, is it the residue of ancient accumulated melancholy, or is it the result of profound questioning in the face of endless time and boundless space? Huy Cận gently sighed:\\n\\nA small fragment of soul\\n\\nBears the eternal sorrow of the ages\\n\\nIs it not just a \"small\" fragment of soul? Yet that eternal sorrow has lingered from countless distant ages. This sorrow indeed has crystallized from countless ancient epochs. This kind of residue is truly different from the intoxicating residue of Vũ Hoàng-Chương:\\n\\nThe season of memories and dreams comes eagerly\\n\\nThe essence of countless ages flickers as residue.\\n\\nFor Vũ, such residue can evoke a light, clear sensation in a person.\\n\\nThe questioning state causes suffering; therefore, sometimes people regret having a mind capable of reasoning and inquiry. It might be better to live unconsciously, without the burden of constant questioning. Nguyễn Công Trứ wished:\\n\\nIn the next life, may I not be human,\\n\\nTo be a pine tree standing in the sky, singing.\\n\\nAnd someone from ancient times lamented in the Book of Odes:\\n\\nThe spring flowers,\\n\\nThe leaves are green,\\n\\nKnowing this, it\\'s better\\n\\nNot to be born.\\n\\nAnd one day, Lý Thái Bạch, embracing a jar of fine wine, wished to forget all worldly matters:\\n\\nLife is like a great dream,\\n\\nWhy toil for this transient existence!',\n",
       " 13: \"However, the attitude of those poets cannot be the genuine attitude of a person living in the world. But what else could they do? How tragic! We wish to conclude that if it is so, then such questioning is a harmful thing; it would be best to find ways to prevent it from arising in the soul. But how can one forbid it? Such questioning is a genuine concern of humanity. Having a mind means having it. The essential thing is to find a method to resolve it.\\n\\nPerhaps Chế Lan Viên once realized that the human mind, veiled by so many base desires, is powerless, unable to unfold the hidden veils of life. First, let us hear the poet's verses filled with questioning:\\n\\nWhy are stars rising from the well's bottom,\\n\\nCold as a dark soul, befriending the spirits.\\n\\nWhose soul resides at the top of my head?\\n\\nWhose thoughts overflow in this mind,\\n\\nTo fly away with laughter, with crying?\\n\\nTruly, these are questions about the self! But here, let us continue to hear the discontented thoughts, and we will understand why human reason is powerless in seeking to understand the true face of life:\\n\\nHow can I always remain as myself?\\n\\nThe flesh follows unsatiated desires,\\n\\nThe blood leaps with the rhythm of others,\\n\\nEyes pursue the brilliance of flowers,\\n\\nOh, the pain! Even the soul,\\n\\nKeeps flying in search of boredom and sorrow,\\n\\nTo determine a wanderer's mind filled with ideas,\\n\\nBut it is not yet time for destruction...\\n\\nWho can tell me: is there a self?\",\n",
       " 14: 'Can someone kindly tell the poet to answer whether he is a real being that exists, or just an absolute emptiness! But oh, who can answer him! The people around him, in the end, are just like him.\\n\\nIs it possible that humanity cannot find the clues to life? Or is it because, as Chế Lan Viên saw, the human mind is obscured by countless desires?\\n\\nOnce upon a time, a prince, for the suffering of humanity, for the great questions of humankind, set out to seek the truth. After much effort to eliminate the countless layers of darkness covering the soul, one day, with radiant wisdom, he found the light. That light he shone everywhere. The former doubts and uncertainties were completely extinguished, and when those doubts were entirely extinguished, a complete joy manifested. The transcendent smile on each person became immortal. To this day, countless beings have followed in his footsteps on the path of truth. Following his example, eliminating desire, increasing love, cultivating wisdom, many have found tranquility in their souls, with a single-minded determination toward the horizon of enlightenment. Here, doubts dissolve, truth is realized, and one is completely liberated from all physical and spiritual constraints. The starting point for this journey to the horizon of enlightenment is a legitimate human question.',\n",
       " 18: 'The remaining Sanskrit scriptures in India were very few during the time of Hodgson and Wright, but why were they so abundant in Nepal? We must find the cause.\\n\\nReading the history of India, who does not see the period when Muslim followers invaded Indian territory, destroying other religions? At that time, around the 9th century, Muslims went about burning scriptures, destroying temples, and burning countless Sanskrit scriptures. Buddhist followers, in the spirit of compassion and non-violence, gathered and preserved the remaining scriptures that were not burnt and took them to Nepal for refuge. They stayed there, and because of this, Buddhism quickly spread in the territory of Nepal, and later scholars found the manuscripts there.\\n\\nFollowing Hodgson and Wright, many other French, British, Japanese, and German scholars made efforts to collect Sanskrit scriptures. Among them, we mention Mr. A. Stein, a Briton; Mr. A. Grünwedel, a German; and Mr. P. Pelliot, a Frenchman. These individuals made significant contributions to providing materials for Buddhist studies.\\n\\nThanks to this, the study of Buddhism has now become much easier.\\n\\nGradually, the Buddhist canon was translated into the languages of many countries. From the original Sanskrit, there were translations into Chinese and then Tibetan. Following that, there were translations into Mongolian, Manchu, and Japanese. Among these translations, the Mongolian and Manchu versions are retranslations, while the Japanese version, although translated directly from Sanskrit, contains many scriptures retranslated from Chinese.',\n",
       " 19: 'Comparing these translations, we find that the Chinese version is the most perfect. In terms of quantity, the Chinese version is already superior. Regarding linguistic aspects, the Chinese language is rich and exquisite, capable of fully conveying the profound meanings of the original. Western scholars often refer to the Chinese translations. However, sometimes, not fully understanding the Chinese linguistic methods, these scholars make rather amusing mistakes.\\n\\nA French orientalist, Mr. A. Rémusat, in his translation of \"The Record of Buddhist Countries by Faxian,\" published in 1836, translated the phrase \"Khắc ngưu đầu chiên đàn tác Phật tượng\" as carving the image of a cow\\'s head and using sandalwood to make a Buddha statue, not knowing that \"ngưu đầu chiên đàn\" is the name of a type of fragrant wood in India, not a cow\\'s head. The British antiquarian J. Fergusson, based on this translation, claimed that Buddhism worships cow heads, and thus classified Buddhism as one of the lower religions (see \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" published in London in 1868).\\n\\nThe translation of Buddhist scriptures in China was organized methodically. From the time of Emperor Ming of the Later Han to the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, over a span of 1,200 years, the translation endeavor continued steadily. A statistical summary reveals that during this period, there were 194 translators who translated 1,440 Buddhist texts, comprising 5,586 volumes. This long period of translation can be divided into two: the period of old translations and the period of new translations.\\n\\nAmong the representative translators of the old translation period, we must mention Kumarajiva (of the Yao Qin era), An Shigao and Lokaksema (of the Later Han era), Zhi Qian (of the Wu era), Zhu Fahu (of the Western Jin era), Buddhayasha (of the Eastern Jin era), Bodhiruci (of the Northern Wei era), and Paramartha (of the Chen era). Most of these venerable figures were foreign monks from India.\\n\\nIn the new translation period, the most famous was the monk Xuanzang. He studied in India for 17 years, mastering Indian languages and deeply understanding Buddhist scriptures. Upon returning to his country, the monk adopted a new translation method, striving to convey the meanings of the original texts, and opened a new era in the history of Chinese translation. After Xuanzang, there were monks such as Yijing, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra... each contributing uniquely. This period was when the Chinese monks took the lead in translations.',\n",
       " 20: 'Over the ages, these translation works became increasingly rich. To prevent loss, many scholars thought of making catalogs of these works. Furthermore, the Chinese highly valued literary records, so they were very concerned with cataloging these translated works. Since Dao An of the Eastern Jin era compiled the general catalog of scriptures, there have been nearly 60 catalogs. Today, twenty remain. This is indeed a wealth of knowledge!\\n\\nAmong them, the most complete is the \"Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu\" by Zhisheng, composed in the 28th year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang dynasty (730 A.D.). In this work, the division and history of translations from various eras are clearly discussed, making it an essential guide for those wishing to study the great canon. According to this book, the existing works consist of 1,076 texts comprising 5,048 volumes. Later generations often considered this number as average and often claimed that the canon contained 5,000 volumes. In reality, the canon does not have a fixed number, as translated works continue to increase.\\n\\nOnce catalogs of the scriptures existed, it became possible to approximately define the scope of the canon. This provided a basis for engraving. By the Tang dynasty, the art of engraving and printing had flourished, so the printing work was carried out. However, a complete engraving of the entire great canon had to wait until the fourth year of the Kaibao era of Emperor Taizu of the Song dynasty to begin and was completed in 983 (in the fifth year of the Taizong Xingguo era). The engraving work continued for 12 years. The great canon was published and soon spread to Japan and Korea. Recently, the Commercial Press in Shanghai has printed the canon using photographic printing (photo printing). In total, there are fourteen editions.\\n\\nDuring the Song dynasty, when the canon was completed, Korea sent for a copy. In 1008, during the 14th year of the Ying Tian era, after Vietnam had reconciled with the Song dynasty, King Lê Đại Hành, hearing about the publication of the great canon in China, sent envoys Minh Xuong and Hoang Thanh Nha to China, offering local products and requesting a copy of the Great Canon. The Song emperor immediately granted it to the Vietnamese envoys.\\n\\nIn 1019, King Lý Thái Tổ also sent envoys Phạm Hạc and Nguyễn Đạo Thanh to China to request the great canon.',\n",

When bestowed by the King of the Song dynasty, a Zen master named Phi Trí was appointed to go all the way to Guangxi to bring it back and display it in the Great Hung library. In Korea, in 1011, King Hiến Tông also ordered the scriptures to be engraved, using the Song version as the original. It took twenty-eight years to complete, but as soon as it was finished, it was destroyed by warfare. In the era of King Cao Tông, in 1236, it was engraved again. This time the engraving process was conducted very carefully, based on various versions, not solely on the Song version as before.

She took advantage of us while we slept by the roadside, ran away, and took all our belongings.\\n\\nThe Buddha beckoned the young men closer and gently said:\\n\\nMy dear young ones! Should you now seek that young woman, or should you seek yourselves?\\n\\nThe young men were bewildered and simultaneously burst into laughter. The Buddha pointed to one who laughed the loudest and said:\\n\\nStop playing the flute.',\n",

The young musicians were amazed; they had never heard such a beautiful sound. The green forest listened, the sky was calm as if cradled, all beings held their breath, silent. The flute sound traveled through the green leaves, glided over the treetops, then soared high into the sky. The marvelous sound seemed to wrap around the stars Altair and Vega, and at that moment, the wind began to rustle through the trees; the sound of the wind was like whispers, like blessings, like praises... like support, to lift the magical flute sound higher and higher...\\n\\nThe Buddha had put the flute down, yet more than thirty young men were still dazed, their spirits immersed in the lingering sound drifting among the clouds.\\n\\nWhen they returned to reality, they noticed the gentle eyes of the sage calmly gazing at them.\\n\\nAll spoke in unison: “Venerable Teacher!

       " 25: \"(Continued and concluded)\\n\\nOne thing to note immediately: Science is a free creation of the human intellect. Scientific laws are established by humans, as long as they align with a large part of the phenomena we observe. No one prohibits a scientist from proposing a law different from Newton's to explain the configuration of the stars. In the realm of physics, laws are often closer to reality, whereas in many other fields like chemistry, laws often have a temporary and hypothetical nature, though they possess great utility. Earlier, I mentioned alignment with a large portion of phenomena to express the relative nature of science. It is relative because that alignment depends on measurements which are never complete. Again, it is relative because scientific laws are only applicable within a certain scope, according to a level. Laws governing phenomena we observe with the naked eye cannot be applied to phenomena we observe with a microscope.\\n\\nThose who have studied thermodynamics surely know the principle that if you place a cold object next to a hot one, the hot object will transfer heat to the cold one until both reach the same temperature. However, those two objects comprise many elements. If examining each element like in the kinetic theory of matter, then the aforementioned Carnot principle becomes invalid: heat at that point no longer has practical meaning and one explains heat by the movement of agitating molecules (quantité de mouvement des molécules en agitation). If two objects placed together consist of a very small number of elements, the exchange of kinetic energy might not be balanced to make both objects reach the same temperature. This is considered from a rigorous theoretical perspective; in practice, an object always contains countless elements: thus, when two objects of different temperatures are placed close, the temperatures always equalize - Because according to the law of probability, this is the most likely case. The Carnot theory, though not absolute, is still applied in many cases.\\n\\nBecause it is a free creation, suitable at each level, it is not surprising that in the evolutionary history of science, many new theories overthrow old ones. Overthrowing here does not mean completely abandoning but means advancing to a higher point of view than the previous one, like leaving a low hill to climb a high mountain, encompassing a broader scene. An example to clarify the meaning: Scientists observe light phenomena. Among those phenomena, they establish a connection called the theory of light traveling in straight lines (théorie de la propagation rectiligne). Whether this is true or not, scientists do not need to know nor can they know. What they need is for the theory to help them encompass and explain many light phenomena (lenses, prisms, etc.). But there are several phenomena like diffraction that cannot be explained with the straight-line theory. Therefore, scientists developed the wave theory (théorie vibratoire) of light, in which light propagates like waves. This theory is broader but more complicated and cannot explain many complex phenomena. Nowadays, the electromagnetic theory (théorie électromagnétique) of light occupies a dominant position, explaining many phenomena and linking optics with electricity and thermodynamics. However, this does not mean the electromagnetic theory has overthrown or killed the other two theories. When necessary, we still study and utilize them. This is because those theories are simpler in explanation than the electromagnetic theory. And while the electromagnetic theory is higher and broader, it still has flaws because it is a free creation of scientists like the other two theories, meaning it has not reached absolute truth. From a fundamental perspective, all three have equal value, so using any theory is not a concern, as long as it yields good results in the current scope.\\n\\nThough a free creation with a relative nature, science is always based on experiments. No matter how promising a theory is, if it is not verified by experiments, scientists must reject it. Similarly, they abandon their theories to follow broader and richer ones. This means a genuine scientist must set aside emotions, pride, and focus only on pursuing objective truth as mentioned above. They do not hesitate because of existing societal prejudices or human pride, failing to place humanity in its true position in the universe. Due to this objective, fair view, science, over centuries, has been hindered by intellectual prejudices, especially by monotheistic religions, preventing its development. Only when scientists abandoned the egocentric view that humans are the center of the Earth, and the Earth is the center of the universe, did science evolve powerfully.\\n\\nThe above provides a brief overview of essential knowledge about science. Now that you understand the main ideas, let us address the most significant issue: the connection between Buddhism and Science. Significant, but it will be brief because, as we have said, it is merely a provisional means. Naturally, we should not criticize science when we have faith and understand causality, seeing that science in itself has no faults. We should not rely on minor details to force Buddhism into science because as science advances, these aspects will continually change. However, we may take scientific discoveries to bring listeners closer to Buddhism. For instance, when the Buddha speaks of the nature of the four great elements pervading the Dharma realm, someone knowledgeable in science would not be surprised; or when saying this body is not us, those who know science will easily accept. Nonetheless, these are aspects to use sparingly, as frequent use can easily lead to errors when we are not truly knowledgeable in both Buddhism and science. Each term and principle in science has a definite meaning, and without clarity, it is easy to misunderstand.\\n\\nHence, when teaching the Dharma and mentioning science, I believe fellow practitioners should speak from a general perspective, relying on the common characteristics as discussed above.\\n\\nWhat is most noteworthy is that science, like Buddhism, values truth highly, regardless of whether that truth is agreeable or not, or whether it contradicts our familiar understanding. To the scientist, humans are merely phenomena among many, with no prejudice about ranking between humans and animals when seeking knowledge. Buddhism is the same. Buddhism considers humans as merely sentient beings, and this world is just one among countless, infinite worlds. Because it does not regard existing prejudices of humans, science helps us consider the unimaginable aspects of Buddhism. Accustomed to the rigorous discipline of science, not hastily judging, accepting, or rejecting until\\n\\ncalmly hearing Buddhist principles,\\n\\nexamining carefully, we shall\\n\\nnot let its contradiction with our learning\\n\\nlead to hastily dismissing or criticizing it.\",\n",
       " 28: 'Only those who seek the path in this way, with earnestness but not overly rash or misguided enthusiasm, can understand and believe in Buddhism. If we are knowledgeable in science, when hearing Buddhism say life is suffering, or that humans must undergo rebirth, we will not react like those who are sentimental or prejudiced, quickly deeming it pessimistic or illogical. Saying so, with very illogical reasoning: \"If life is suffering, then it’s easy to become disillusioned with life, if there is rebirth, how could we become oxen or dogs?\" please, fellow practitioners, remember\\n\\nto encompass\\n\\nIn fundamental principles\\n\\nare foundational principles, not detailed minutiae. Science\\n\\nrelies on the law of causality to explore the laws connecting phenomena in the universe. Buddhism is the same. Generally and broadly, Buddhism says if there is cause, there is effect. But saying effect is simply talking about a general aspect concerning the life of sentient beings. If precisely stated, it should be called dependent origination. And in the dependent origination of the nature of the Dharma realm, is there a Dharma that doesn’t relate to another? Therefore, speaking of causality is but a small part of a grand universal principle encompassing the universe. Thus, causality in that sense is only relative, only partially true, not absolutely true. Science also acknowledges this. The laws they create are only true within a certain scope, as the phenomena they observe cannot be isolated at will. There are countless influences affecting the phenomena they observe, which they must ignore, countless experimental errors they cannot avoid. This notion of relativity in science can bring us closer to understanding Buddhism, because within the wondrous function of the true mind, all Dharmas manifest. Is there any Dharma that is independently established, any Dharma that doesn’t relate to all other Dharmas?\\n\\nEven though material phenomena are relative, with myriad forms and shapes, scientists still intend to find a common connection for all those phenomena, aiming towards the objective truth as defined earlier. Thus, they dissect matter to the utmost, and today, theory and experiment have proven that matter and energy consist of the subtlest particles, electrons or photons (électron, photon). The matter we see, even light, heat, and electricity we use, all share a common foundation. Although the connection is somewhat temporary, we can say: this helps us acknowledge the Buddhist concept that all Dharmas are one true mind.\\n\\nIn the book \"Buddhism for Beginners,\" we have shown that the method of scientific inquiry resembles the practice methods of Buddhist practitioners.',\n",
       " 29: \"Beginning with discipline: eliminate anything that might hinder or obstruct our observation. Next is concentration: focus on the task without letting the mind stray from the subject under study. Finally, wisdom: through concentration, one discovers a principle, illuminating the phenomenon, connecting disparate results into a harmonious system (see the section on Buddhism and science in Basic Buddhism).\\n\\nTo conclude these comparisons, I think we should draw attention to a connection that I consider the most significant. Science represents a particular state of the human mind's desire to know, to know clearly, to know to the extreme, even if it means conflicting with nature, even if it means enduring bitterness and suffering. For that knowledge has revealed to us the humble position of humanity in the universe. The overly developed knowledge that focuses on material objects, with an objective perspective, has caused many superior minds to feel the need to balance it with some emotion, some faith, some compassion. Then, from one extreme to the other — as often happens, many people tend toward emotion and turn to criticize reason, praising religious faith while condemning science. But religions that focus only on emotion, only advocating love, fall into the pitfall of making people easily superstitious, and because of superstition and ignorance, they harm people under the guise of compassion. This is not surprising. Religious wars are proof of the harmfulness of such bias. Buddhism cannot, because Buddhism encompasses both compassion and wisdom. Love but know why we love, how to truly love. Wisdom and compassion always go hand in hand in Buddhism, regardless of the level or method of practice. The benefit of science for us Buddhists may be to demonstrate the importance of understanding so that we can further clarify the importance of wisdom in Buddhism.\\n\\nViên Đình\\n\\nVietnamese Buddhism\",\n",

He looked back at his body and saw himself emaciated: His body was thin and frail, merely skin wrapped over bones. The strong force of his spirit had sustained his body to some extent, but because of his intense focus on practice, he had neglected to nourish his physical form.\\n\\nFormerly, he had opposed the ascetics. Now he had unintentionally followed their path. So, he stood up and went to the riverbank of the Nairanjana.\\n\\nHowever, being too weak, he collapsed under a tree. A shepherdess passing by saw him and quickly ran over to offer him a bowl of milk.\\n\\nHe received it and felt invigorated; all his noble signs reappeared as before. The shepherdess, astonished, thought he was a deity and knelt at a distance with folded hands in reverence.\\n\\nHe gestured for the shepherdess to come closer and pour him a second bowl of milk. The shepherdess remained bowed.\\n\\n“Please, my Lord, you are a divine being, and I am but a humble Brahmin. I dare not approach you.”\\n\\nThe gentle Prince replied, “Do not be afraid, come here and pour me another cup. I am no divine being, just an ordinary person. I do not differentiate between my noble lineage and your Brahmin lineage. You are a person, just like me. There cannot be a class division separating one person from another, nor can there be distinctions of noble and humble among those who share the same blood.”\\n\\nThe shepherdess joyfully came closer and poured milk for him.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, the villagers near the forest heard of this, and at noon, they brought milk, honey, and other food offerings. He accepted them equally, nourishing his body to restore the balance and harmony between body and spirit, then resumed his contemplation as before.\\n\\nOne day, a servant of Lady Sujata went into the forest and, passing by, saw Him sitting majestically under a tree glowing with radiant light. Astonished, he hurried back to report to his mistress.\\n\\nLady Sujata, upon hearing this, immediately recognized it as a good omen, indicating that the one sitting under the tree was near enlightenment. She ordered her servants to prepare a golden bowl with fragrant milk and personally offered it.\\n\\nUpon nearing him, seeing the radiant light emanating from the Prince\\'s face, Lady Sujata was filled with awe and knelt down, saying:\\n\\n\"I have come to offer milk in this golden bowl, may you be pleased to accept it.\"\\n\\nWithout daring to look, she reverently placed the golden bowl before the Prince and returned home, her heart elated.\\n\\nAfter the prince finished his repast, he took the golden bowl and walked towards the Nairanjana River. He tossed the golden bowl into the river, saying:\\n\\n\"If I am to attain Buddhahood, then this golden bowl must float on the surface and flow upstream against the current.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he spoke, the golden bowl rose to the surface and swiftly floated against the current.\\n\\nThe prince entered the river to bathe. He emerged with a refreshed spirit. A voice within seemed to encourage him, saying that just a little more effort to overcome the final difficult passage would lead him to enlightenment.\\n\\nA young shepherd passed by, carrying four bundles of grass on his back. Seeing the Prince, the boy felt a surge of joy within. He placed the four bundles of grass and his sickle on the ground, bowed with folded hands, and said:\\n\\n\"I have nothing but a sickle and four bundles of grass, I don\\'t know what to offer you.\"\\n\\nThe gentle Prince replied, \"If you wish, you may offer me one of those young bundles of grass.\"\\n\\nThe boy happily placed a bundle of grass in the Prince\\'s hands and saluted him.\\n\\nThe Prince took the bundle, spread its contents beneath a large bodhi tree, its lush green leaves providing shade over a wide area.\\n\\nGazing at the blue sky, the green mountains, then at the bodhi tree, and down at the grass mat he had just laid out, the Prince declared:\\n\\n\"Though my flesh and bones may waste away, though my body may be exhausted, I shall not leave this Bodhi tree until I have found the Way.\"\\n\\nWith that, he calmly sat down in the lotus position, crossing his legs.\\n\\nThat night was the seventh night of the lunar month.

Mara, the Evil One, realizing that defeat was imminent due to the radiant light of Enlightenment, hurried to the Bodhi tree.\\n\\n\"You there,\" Mara said, pointing at the Prince, \"how much light do you have that you dare to aspire to illuminate the path for humanity?\"\\n\\nTurning away, Mara showed the Prince the pitch-black four corners of the sky, with all the stars obscured by clouds.\\n\\nThe Prince did not respond. A beam of light from his forehead swept away all the clouds, and the sky returned to its clear state, with stars twinkling brightly.\\n\\nMara angrily shouted, \"What do you intend to do with your light?\"\\n\\n\"I will use the light of my Way to guide sentient beings, leading all creatures out of the darkness of ignorance to liberation.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, liberation for all beings! I see you have no hope of accomplishing that.\"\\n\\n\"I will achieve that.\"\\n\\n\"Who will testify to your words?\"\\n\\nThe Prince pointed to the earth. \"The earth shall bear witness to my words.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the earth trembled. The Earth Deity appeared, scattering flowers in offering to the Prince and glaring at Mara, forcing him to retreat.\\n\\nThe Prince remained silent in meditation, his mind and body rejuvenated.\\n\\nBy the fourth watch, when the Prince had just attained the knowledge of past lives, seeing clearly all his previous existences, Mara returned.\\n\\nHe assumed the form of the beautiful Lady Yasodhara, accompanied by the most charming maidens from the royal palace, who had once served the Prince.\\n\\nWith a mournful beauty, the false Yasodhara approached the Prince, weeping and pleading for him to return.',\n",

Looking to the Past\\nWithout close observation, one might mistakenly think Tu Dam is a completely new pagoda, but the faded sign in front of the Buddha hall reveals that the pagoda's original name was An-Ton, built during the Le Dynasty in the year Quy Ti (1683), during the time of the Northern and Southern conflicts. In the first year of Emperor Thieu Tri, it was renamed Tu Dam Pagoda (as inscribed on the sign at the Ancestral House).\\nThe pagoda was established by Venerable Minh-Hoang Tu Dung. He was a native of Guangdong, China, invited by Venerable Nguyen Thieu under the order of Lord Nguyen Phuc Trang (1687-1691), also known as Lord Anh Ton, to come to Vietnam. After transmitting precepts to the Sangha at Linh Mu Pagoda with Venerables Thach Liem, Minh-Vat, Minh Hai, etc., he stayed in Hue to cultivate and teach. He belonged to the third generation of the Lam Te lineage.\\nHe was a person of both virtue and talent. He transmitted the Dharma and certified Venerable Lieu Quan, a Vietnamese, who became the first Zen patriarch in Central and Southern Vietnam.\\n\\nVII. Its Historical Role\\nTu Dam Pagoda not only serves as a place of worship and study for Buddhist followers but also plays a significant role in the evolutionary history of the Vietnamese nation.\\nIn the era of the Northern and Southern conflicts, Hue was a new land: all political and religious sectors were still in their infancy, and the majority of the population, newly emigrated from the North, along with a number of assimilated Cham people, lacked a stable place to establish their livelihoods and a true spiritual belief for their mental life.\\nThis pagoda, along with Venerable Tu Dung, as well as Quoc An Pagoda with Venerable Nguyen Thieu, Linh Mu Pagoda with Venerable Thach Liem, etc., accomplished these tasks.\\nThrough numerous changes: the pagoda was repaired many times, old people passed on, and new ones succeeded; the venerables Thuc Vinh, Sat Ngu, Dao Trung, Thanh Dong, etc., continued this sacred mission.\\nBy 1936, the pagoda was entrusted by the Buddhist Congregation to the Buddhist Studies Association to serve as a center for spreading the Dharma. As the Buddhist Studies movement grew, the role of this pagoda became increasingly important. It not only served as a place of worship and study for a number of nearby Buddhists in Hue, but it also...\",\n",

       " 's:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:04': 'Now, to introduce the story of Unification is to indirectly acknowledge that there is still something that remains ununified, or if unified, it is not yet complete.\\n\\nIndeed, it is so.\\n\\nIs it necessary to unify Vietnamese Buddhism? Among us Buddhists, who would not feel a twinge of shame upon hearing this question? Being disciples of the Buddha, those who pride themselves on living within the spirit of great compassion and respect of the supreme teachings, yet we have often struggled and faced difficulties with the issue of unification.\\n\\nIn truth, for Buddhism, this matter of unification should not even be an issue.\\n\\nFor Buddhists, unification should not be a challenging matter.\\n\\nYet, to this day, we still find ourselves discussing unification, and moreover, we must continue to tirelessly build upon the foundation of unity.\\n\\nIs it perhaps because we lack the talent? Or because we lack the spirit of harmony? Or is it that we are not very passionate about the work of unification?\\n\\nIn the declaration of the establishment of the General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism, announced in 1951, the Buddhist delegates nationwide earnestly called:\\n\\n\"Oh, all Vietnamese Buddhists, let us level the differences, unite in heart and mind to fulfill the mission of creating peace, sowing the seeds of joy, and raising high the torch of wisdom of the Blessed One.\"\\n\\nThe echo of that heartfelt call still resonates in our souls. The foundation has been laid. Buddhists nationwide joyfully welcomed the day of Unified Buddhism. The unification movement gained strength, and everywhere, the resounding songs of young Buddhists praised that great endeavor of unity:\\n\\n\"Vietnamese Buddhism unifies North, South, Central from now on.\\n\\nWith one heart, we advance for the sacred path!\\n\\nLet us rejoice in the radiant golden light of the Dharma, shining in all directions.\\n\\nResounding songs welcome Vietnamese Buddhism...\"\\n\\nThe Buddhist community has passionately embraced the unification movement, yearning for unification, demanding unification.\\n\\nThat alone is enough to prove that the work of unification can indeed be fully realized. The Buddhist masses have never harbored distinctions between one Buddhist organization and another. Consider the event of the Relic Procession years ago in the capital, which stands as compelling evidence; all the various Buddhist organizations in the South joined forces to organize a grand and solemn ceremony. A sea of people with tens of thousands of Buddhist flags created an unprecedented jubilant atmosphere in the capital, and Dr. Malalasekera, president of the world Buddhist organization, did not withhold words of praise upon witnessing the spectacle.\\n\\nThus, we cannot say that Vietnamese Buddhists lack the spirit of harmony, nor can we say that we are not very passionate about the work of unification.\\n\\nSo why is it that, to this day, besides the General Association, there are still other groups operating independently?\\n\\nClearly, it is due to a lack of mutual understanding and knowledge among the Buddhist groups within and outside the General Association. The six groups within the General Association of Buddhism, during the second congress in the capital Saigon, outlined a program of unification...',\n",
       " 's:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:05': 'Buddhists, have contributed to the collective construction\\n\\nproviding a firm foundation for Vietnamese Buddhism. The\\n\\nmonks and lay practitioners leading the Buddhist organizations within the General\\n\\nAssociation have shown great enthusiasm. Yet, the atmosphere of the capital at the\\n\\nsecond congress was perhaps not as vibrant as the people\\'s hopes,\\n\\nbecause there remained many other Buddhist groups\\n\\nobserving the congress with an objective, almost\\n\\ncool demeanor.\\n\\nThe General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism must open its arms wide to invite\\n\\nfellow Buddhist groups. The General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism must\\n\\nbe the great family of all Vietnamese Buddhists. In reality,\\n\\nto achieve this modern unity, the groups within the General Association must first\\n\\ndemonstrate deep understanding and must always avoid anything that could\\n\\ncause misunderstanding or harm the foundation of unity. The groups outside the General Association,\\n\\namong them the original Buddhist group, must also\\n\\nacknowledge that the realization of \"harmony\" is the most urgent and\\n\\nimportant task in the current stage. Buddhism is the force\\n\\nof Peace. The General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism is our communal body.\\n\\nIn the harmonious symphony of unity, let us offer ourselves as a harmonious sound.\\n\\nIn building the unified Buddhist house, let us transform ourselves into a foundational stone.\\n\\nOne day, the individual identities of all groups will be erased,\\n\\nand we will only see one unified and great community: that\\n\\nis - Unified Vietnamese Buddhism.\\n\\nO leaders of Buddhist groups within and outside the General Association! The Buddhist masses are looking to you.\\n\\nVietnamese Buddhists desire unity and great solidarity in\\n\\nthe spirit of the six harmonies of construction. Do not go against the wishes of\\n\\nour Buddhists. A significant part of the heavy responsibility lies with you.\\n\\nThe history of Vietnamese Buddhism will later record your names. Whether\\n\\nmerit or fault lies with us depends on whether we are wise and sincere in building unity.\\n\\nMay you be wise to avoid the traps and schemes of the external forces\\n\\nseeking to destroy the true Dharma and obstruct the unified Buddhist foundation.\\n\\nP. G.\\n\\nMillions of eyes are focused on you.\\n\\nProve yourselves worthy as enlightened leaders\\n\\nso as not to let down the hopes of all our Vietnamese Buddhists.\\n\\nIs Buddhism\\n\\na religion or not? Many have asked this question, considering it\\n\\nimportant. In truth,\\n\\nthis question is not very important.\\n\\nWhether we call Buddhism\\n\\na religion, a philosophy,\\n\\nor even a science,\\n\\nBuddhism remains Buddhism,\\n\\nunchanged.\\n\\nBefore me is a Buddhist dictionary.\\n\\nI say: I see the dictionary. If someone asks\\n\\nhow I can see the dictionary, I will answer that\\n\\nI have eyes.\\n\\n• Because I have eyes * this answer is correct, not wrong. But\\n\\nto say it is wholly correct is insufficient, because\\n\\nbesides the eyes, many other conditions are needed:\\n\\nlight, space,\\n\\nvisual consciousness, mental consciousness, etc.\\n\\nThus, stating that Buddhism is\\n\\na religion, or stating that * Buddhism\\n\\nis a philosophy, are both correct.\\n\\nBut not entirely correct. The reason is\\n\\nwhen we speak thus, we are only viewing one\\n\\naspect of Buddhism.\\n\\nHowever, even standing on the aspect\\n\\nof belief, we can examine and determine whether Buddhism\\n\\nis compatible with the spirit of democracy.\\n\\nThe thought of Auguste Comte can\\n\\nrepresent the philosophical thought of the late nineteenth and\\n\\nearly twentieth centuries before the\\n\\nEuropean wars. Comte affirmed the\\n\\nprogressive nature of human thought, and\\n\\nbased on that, he divided the history\\n\\nof human thought into three periods:\\n\\nThe period of religion, that\\n\\nis the ancient period.\\nThe period of philosophy, from the\\n\\nbeginning of the sixteenth century to the beginning of the\\n\\nnineteenth century.\\nThe period of science, from\\n\\nthe nineteenth century onwards.\\n\\nThe period of religion is the period of superstition.\\n\\nThe period of philosophy is the period of idealism.\\n\\nThe period of science is the period of empirical\\n\\nexperiment. This is roughly Comte\\'s categorization.\\n\\nWe see this categorization\\n\\nas still ambiguous and not without errors.\\n\\nTo claim religion, philosophy, and\\n\\nscience represent three periods\\n\\nis quite an awkward endeavor. Humanity in the first period\\n\\n—the period of religion, according to Comte—\\n\\ndid they not have philosophical and scientific thoughts?\\n\\nHumanity in the second period—the period of philosophy—\\n\\ndid they not have religious and philosophical thoughts?\\n\\nThus, this categorization\\n\\nis somewhat mechanical, and this\\n\\nis the major error of the French philosopher.\\n\\nReligion, philosophy, and science are\\n\\nconcrete manifestations of human thought. Each has its own\\n\\nprogressive trajectory, its own origin.\\n\\nAuguste Comte only saw\\n\\nthat these three have dynamics, evolution,\\n\\nbut he could not see\\n\\ntheir true nature.\\n\\nIn ancient times, religious thought\\n\\nwas still immature and naive; during this period,\\n\\nthere arose both immature philosophical reasoning, erroneous and\\n\\nnot concrete. At the same time,\\n\\nscience also emerged: developing tools, utensils for practical human usage,\\n\\nharnessing water power to pound rice, discovering fire...\\n\\nall are initial achievements of science. Although these\\n\\nare not the ages of airplanes, cannons, and atoms,\\n\\nwithout the naïve and rudimentary stages, there would be no age of mature\\n\\nsophistication.\\n\\nFrom the nineteenth century to the present, science\\n\\nhas advanced rapidly and remarkably: philosophy and religion\\n\\nhave followed and made progress. Currently, Western philosophy,\\n\\ndue to new influences,\\n\\nhas begun to be constructed on a scientific foundation,\\n\\nand has resolved many new issues.\\n\\nReligion has the aspiration to resolve\\n\\nthe origins of the universe and human life,\\n\\nbut it always needs faith\\n\\nfirst and foremost. Philosophy also seeks to have\\n\\na comprehensive vision like religion,\\n\\nbut desires to be impartial. Science,\\n\\nin turn, is a detailed examination.\\n\\nNot building upon faith,\\n\\nphilosophy must continually rely\\n\\non experimentation to find a firm\\n\\nstand. Therefore, philosophy\\n\\nplays the role of synthesis, it is the result\\n\\nof harmonizing both science and religion.\\n\\nThus, philosophy has denounced\\n\\nmisguided superstitious religions and supported\\n\\ngenuine religions, suitable with the level\\n\\nof civilization of contemporary society.\\n\\nStanding between religion and science, sometimes\\n\\nphilosophy explains things\\n\\nthat science has not yet comprehended. Though\\n\\nstill within the realm of ideals,\\n\\nsuch things could be future discoveries\\n\\nof empirical science.\\n\\nThrough the investigation of beliefs\\n\\nand guiding discoveries,\\n\\nphilosophy is also called a stimulating factor\\n\\nfor religion and science.\\n\\nThe welfare of society depends greatly\\n\\non human concepts of all three\\n\\naspects: religion, science,\\n\\nand philosophy. Many people do not understand\\n\\nthis, yet believe that society only\\n\\nneeds empirical science.\\n\\nThis bias is a consequence of\\n\\nthe influence of Comte\\'s three-stage theory.\\n\\nBelieving that religion is a representative\\n\\nof human thought in ancient times,\\n\\nunsuitable for today\\'s civilized world,\\n\\nmany advocate\\n\\nthat religion is unnecessary. Some\\n\\npolitical parties even call for\\n\\n\"down with religion,\" creating\\n\\na movement within a chaotic society.\\n\\nIn truth, humanity cannot\\n\\nexist without belief. Reviewing\\n\\nhistory, we see that religion is indeed\\n\\nthe foundation of social cohesion.\\n\\nThe Islamic nation has forbidden its\\n\\npeople from believing in any religion\\n\\nother than Islam, simultaneously\\n\\nusing political power to conquer weaker neighbors. The Communist Party\\n\\nonly trusts in one - the \"unique\" communist ideology, believing firmly\\n\\nin this ideology as if in divinity.\\n\\nUnder the red flag, the center of cohesion\\n\\nis the ideology of Karl Marx. Relying\\n\\non that ideology to mobilize, to\\n\\nconcentrate the thoughts and will of the people, to\\n\\ncomplete the form of\\n\\ncommunist party rule, is akin to promoting a kind\\n\\nof religion: communist religion. Thus,\\n\\nparty society or communist party, even if calling for the downfall\\n\\nof religion, merely seeks to overthrow old religions,\\n\\nto establish a \"new religion\" of their own.\\n\\nUltimately, belief remains\\n\\nvery necessary for the cohesion\\n\\nof society.\\n\\nThus, we have seen the extremely\\n\\nimportant position of belief in\\n\\nconstructing a new society. An erroneous\\n\\nbelief system can create an\\n\\nautocratic society, can lead people\\n\\nto a path of conquest,\\n\\ncausing unwholesome karma. A genuine\\n\\nbelief foundation is needed for people\\n\\nto truly achieve\\n\\ngreat cohesion, a powerful social force,\\n\\nnot directing humanity towards autocracy,\\n\\noppression, conquest.\\n\\nThe cohesive force of humanity\\n\\n—social nature—hence is very necessary\\n\\nfor humanity, but the most concrete and complete\\n\\norganizational condition of society is still the nation.\\n\\nEach nation can be a unit for that\\n\\ngreat cohesive force. Every nation has\\n\\na belief in the universe (cosmology)\\n\\nto serve as the backdrop for its unique\\n\\nview of humanity. Relying\\n\\non cosmic belief, people have\\n\\na human view which is\\n\\nan imitation of the natural world to\\n\\norganize human relations. The ancient\\n\\npolitics of China took the phrase \"following heaven and\\n\\nobserving earth,\" as its foundation for that reason.\\n\\nSociety\\'s customs, religion\\n\\nare all dependent upon the conditions\\n\\nof belief in that cosmology, and\\n\\nhence, the foundation of the nation\\n\\ncan be stable.\\n\\nTherefore, reflection on this,\\n\\nwe see that belief in a cosmology is the point\\n\\nof concentration of thought and will of a nation.\\n\\nNow, discussing the democratic regime,\\n\\nis to speak of a form\\n\\nof political society. Let us examine\\n\\nhow religion relates to social\\n\\nand political organization, then determine\\n\\nwhether Buddhism is compatible\\n\\nwith the spirit of democracy.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the relationship\\n\\nbetween religion and politics, history\\n\\nof humanity can be divided into three\\n\\nperiods:\\n\\nFirst is the ancient period. This\\n\\nis the age of polytheism. In those times,\\n\\nhuman intellect was still naive,\\n\\nthus in all activities, people always\\n\\nfelt threatened by nature. Hence, humanity\\n\\ndeveloped fear of nature, believing each\\n\\nphenomenon in the universe was governed by\\n\\na divine being: god of wind,\\n\\ngod of rain, god of thunder, god of lightning, god\\n\\nof mountains, god of rivers...\\n\\nFear then led to veneration,\\n\\nbelief, and supplication. Therefore,\\n\\nthat period is called the age of polytheism.\\nAt that time, humans lived in\\n\\ntribes, each tribe led by a\\n\\nchieftain. That political system naturally took\\n\\nthe cosmology of polytheism as its backdrop.\\nHuman intellect gradually expanded.\\n\\nFrom polytheistic belief, humanity advanced to\\n\\nmonotheistic belief, believing that the universe\\n\\nand humanity were created by a supreme\\n\\ndivine being. Though the phenomena of the universe\\n\\nwere diverse and complex, they were all\\n\\nproduced by a single divine.\\n\\nThis is the period of monotheism.\\n\\nPolitics in that era was\\n\\norganized in the form of monarchy.\\n\\nDue to monotheistic cosmology,\\n\\nmonarchical theocratic autocratic forms arose.',\n",
       " 's:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:06': 'In the contemporary era, human consciousness has advanced rapidly. People have become aware of their own value and rights, leading to collective movements to abolish the monarchy and establish a system of egalitarian democracy. People have gradually realized that the success or failure, prosperity or decline of a nation does not rest in the hands of a king, but in the hands of the entire populace. Each individual, in relation to society and the supreme organization of the nation, must have equivalent duties and enjoy equivalent rights.\\n\\nThe center of unity is where each individual recognizes their duty as a citizen in a democratic nation, comprehends what democracy entails, and practices according to democratic principles. Duties and rights are shared and enjoyed without class distinction, completely equal. The central point is the community spirit of the people. In other words, each individual is a central point.\\n\\nDuring the period when civil rights are expanding, polytheistic and monotheistic beliefs are no longer suitable and naturally cannot sustain themselves. There must be a classless religion, a religion where the truth of equality is promulgated, a religion that affirms the creative and constructive value of each person — to serve as the focal point for the faith of the entire populace, and to be the foundation for the development of individuality and community traits.\\n\\nHere, only Buddhism is worthy.\\n\\nBuddhist philosophy also proposes a cosmology: overthrowing the superstitious cosmology of monotheism and polytheism to establish a cosmology based on interdependent origination.\\n\\nInterdependent origination means the events of mutual relation, mutual causation, and mutual formation. Whether the universe, society, and humanity are good or bad, all are the result of human actions. The bodily, verbal, and mental actions of individuals collectively create a universe, a society. The driving force behind all success, failure, merit, and demerit, good and bad, lies in the individual and collective karma of all beings.\\n\\nThis belief in a cosmology of interdependent origination and collective karma is very suitable with the current social concept of equality. Here, humans are not to submit to deities, but rather see themselves as fully responsible for their own happiness. Such a genuine belief, affirming the value of human duties and rights so firmly, is indeed very fitting with human aspirations and abilities, and ultimately, can serve as the foundation for building a truly democratic society, respecting equality and freedom.\\n\\nA nation that adopts the belief in a cosmology of interdependent origination and collective karma as its backdrop can achieve profound unity and can build a humanistic and virtuous national culture.\\n\\nTherefore, we conclude that Buddhism is the belief that serves as the foundation for building a democratic society.\\n\\nD. T.\\n\\nVietnamese Buddhism\\n\\nArticle by Minh Hạnh\\n\\nIn society, there are two types of people who do not see themselves truly living: those who are extremely poor and those who roll themselves along the slope of desires. The first type toils throughout the year in the struggle for survival, leaving no time to contemplate the meaning of life. Material deprivation exhausts them, leaving them no free moment. They pour all their thoughts into work, worry, and sorrow due to failure and suffering, and they hardly ever question the meaning of life. Though they might occasionally pause to suddenly realize that life is suffering, thinking that living is to endure pain, such thoughts merely flicker in their minds and then sink into their subconscious. Reality awaits them: where is the time to endlessly ponder the value of life! Thus, they return to work, and until the last moment of their lives, they live and operate like machines, obeying some external, mysterious force.\\n\\nThe second type obeys the call of sensual pleasures daily, immersing themselves in bodily delights, thereby forgetting they are living within a human society. These people, naturally, must possess considerable wealth, whether inherited from parents or obtained through unethical means. Perhaps some among this group intentionally forget life. Why do they wish to forget life? This is easily understood. They have not comprehended life, seen the true value of existence, to claim they have forgotten it! Forgetting life here is just a guise for the bankruptcy of conscience, a statement to cover all that is most vile and rotten in humanity. Forgetting life means wanting no more connection with the world, yet the means used to forget life — money — are still deceitfully exploited within life itself!\\n\\nThe first type deserves our sympathy, if not our compassion. The second type initially evokes our aversion, but in truth, they are even more deserving of pity. Two opposing circumstances sharing the same fate: they are the least living, for they rarely realize they are alive; in other words, they seldom question the true value of life.\\n\\nBut fortunately, these people are few. Let no one be so pessimistic as to believe that all laborers are in the dire situations depicted in *Mother Lê\\'s House* by Thạch Lam or *The Workers Going to Work* by Lan Khai. No! Our country\\'s so-called \"realist\" writers have pushed our imagination too far from reality!\\n\\nLikewise, let no one be so pessimistic as to believe that the moths attracted to the flame of decadence can pollute the current society. We, who are fortunate enough to have a little time to ponder life, recognize that humans cannot live indifferently like plants. We cannot let life drift by with merely eating, sleeping, sleeping, and eating. We must seek something higher than mere sustenance. This tendency to \"seek\" is inherent in us and often keeps us in constant questioning.\\n\\nSometimes, looking up at the vast sky, vast rivers and mountains, and then back at ourselves, we are moved to ask: why is the sky so deep? Why do countless stars twinkle? Where did those mountains and rivers come from? What is our body? Why were we born here? Where do we come from and where will we go?\\n\\nIn the infinite space and endless time, we feel small and strangely pitiful. We long to understand these perplexing questions. Many questions leave us speechless before the vast universe. We suffer because of our questioning, our desire to understand. We suffer, yet we find that we need to suffer in this way; for this suffering gives us a profound and expansive understanding of our life.\\n\\nA poet, Thế Lữ, after traversing many memories and loves entangled in the ephemeral life, one day suddenly finds himself before the infinitely vast scene:\\n\\nThe sun gradually sets\\n\\nHigh in the sky, clouds drift leisurely\\n\\nA distant boat, sails upright, stands still,\\n\\nThe sea surface as smooth as a gray silk screen.\\n\\nThe wet beach, reflecting the bright sky,\\n\\nI step up, a person in the void,\\n\\nHearing the faint sound of the wind,\\n\\nThe whispering of the silent pines,\\n\\nWith the waves gently lapping in intervals of silence...\\n\\nBefore such a vast water and sky scene, one suddenly feels alone:\\n\\nI look far and wide, the distant seas,\\n\\nAlone with the vastness in my heart,\\n\\nLike a wanderer dazed,\\n\\nLost in the desolate lands,\\n\\nI carry a somber love,\\n\\nSeeking yet not finding the profound truth in creation.\\n\\nThe poet has shared our concern for the truth of life! The feeling of a wanderer lost in the desolate land, oh, how cold and lonely it is! The poet has longed to understand the profound truth of life, of creation, \"seeking but not finding.\" But how did the poet seek, or was it merely with a heart burdened with memories and sorrows?\\n\\nPaused in dismay, I look at the clouds, at the waters,\\n\\nLook at the blue sky with a solemn face,\\n\\nIn the four directions, the horizon is vague,\\n\\nAnd I ask: where is the truth?\\n\\nThe universe is vast and boundless. And before the poet\\'s eyes, the blue sky, the vast sea, the high clouds... Seeing these phenomena, the poet was bewildered, longing to understand. This longing reached a peak, causing the poet to question, to suffer. How tragic it is, when before the earnest questions of a person longing for truth, the universe remains silent, indifferent, and unfeeling, offering no answer:\\n\\nAsking the profound, boundless, and endless scenes,\\n\\nClouds always flying, waves always lapping, wind never stopping\\n\\nAsking if you hear my voice,\\n\\nHear the voice of a suffering soul?\\n\\nI thirst to know the wondrous truth in the universe:\\n\\nBut alas! creation remains silent,\\n\\nFor thousands of years, keeping an indifferent face,\\n\\nAloof, mysterious, and sublime...\\n\\nThe universe remains silent, unwilling to unveil its mysterious veil. Humans will never find peace in life if their great inner questions are not resolved. Poet Trần Tử Ngang of old, when standing before infinite space and endless time, also felt perplexed and sorrowful, moved to tears:\\n\\nBefore me, no ancient people,\\n\\nBehind me, no future beings;\\n\\nContemplating the vast universe,\\n\\nAlone, I shed tears...\\n\\nA certain poet translated it as follows:\\n\\nWho has passed before?\\n\\nWho has yet to be born?\\n\\nPondering the endless sky and earth,\\n\\nAlone, I shed a tear.\\n\\nOh, how painful! Before us, who were they, and after us, who will they be? Why do we appear in life only to one day disappear, as easily as a drop of water in the vast ocean? The tear of the poet is indeed valuable, worth a thousand gold. It is the tear that springs from a heart filled with deep questioning. A very genuine questioning. Many have cried, and human tears indeed rival the waters of the four great oceans. But most human tears have flowed in the bitterness and suffering of life. How few have been like Trần Tử Ngang, crying for the thirst for truth. That tear truly possesses unparalleled value.\\n\\nIn our souls, impressions of joy and sorrow follow one another through the continuous flow of time. However, joyful moments fade more quickly than sorrows. The deep, lingering sorrow of humanity, is it the residue of ancient accumulated melancholy, or is it the result of profound questioning in the face of endless time and boundless space? Huy Cận gently sighed:\\n\\nA small fragment of soul\\n\\nBears the eternal sorrow of the ages\\n\\nIs it not just a \"small\" fragment of soul? Yet that eternal sorrow has lingered from countless distant ages. This sorrow indeed has crystallized from countless ancient epochs. This kind of residue is truly different from the intoxicating residue of Vũ Hoàng-Chương:\\n\\nThe season of memories and dreams comes eagerly\\n\\nThe essence of countless ages flickers as residue.\\n\\nFor Vũ, such residue can evoke a light, clear sensation in a person.\\n\\nThe questioning state causes suffering; therefore, sometimes people regret having a mind capable of reasoning and inquiry. It might be better to live unconsciously, without the burden of constant questioning. Nguyễn Công Trứ wished:\\n\\nIn the next life, may I not be human,\\n\\nTo be a pine tree standing in the sky, singing.\\n\\nAnd someone from ancient times lamented in the Book of Odes:\\n\\nThe spring flowers,\\n\\nThe leaves are green,\\n\\nKnowing this, it\\'s better\\n\\nNot to be born.\\n\\nAnd one day, Lý Thái Bạch, embracing a jar of fine wine, wished to forget all worldly matters:\\n\\nLife is like a great dream,\\n\\nWhy toil for this transient existence!\\n\\nHowever, the attitude of those poets cannot be the genuine attitude of a person living in the world. But what else could they do? How tragic! We wish to conclude that if it is so, then such questioning is a harmful thing; it would be best to find ways to prevent it from arising in the soul. But how can one forbid it? Such questioning is a genuine concern of humanity. Having a mind means having it. The essential thing is to find a method to resolve it.\\n\\nPerhaps Chế Lan Viên once realized that the human mind, veiled by so many base desires, is powerless, unable to unfold the hidden veils of life. First, let us hear the poet\\'s verses filled with questioning:\\n\\nWhy are stars rising from the well\\'s bottom,\\n\\nCold as a dark soul, befriending the spirits.\\n\\nWhose soul resides at the top of my head?\\n\\nWhose thoughts overflow in this mind,\\n\\nTo fly away with laughter, with crying?\\n\\nTruly, these are questions about the self! But here, let us continue to hear the discontented thoughts, and we will understand why human reason is powerless in seeking to understand the true face of life:\\n\\nHow can I always remain as myself?\\n\\nThe flesh follows unsatiated desires,\\n\\nThe blood leaps with the rhythm of others,\\n\\nEyes pursue the brilliance of flowers,\\n\\nOh, the pain! Even the soul,\\n\\nKeeps flying in search of boredom and sorrow,\\n\\nTo determine a wanderer\\'s mind filled with ideas,\\n\\nBut it is not yet time for destruction...\\n\\nWho can tell me: is there a self?',\n",
       " 's:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:07': 'Can someone kindly tell the poet to answer whether he is a real being that exists, or just an absolute emptiness! But oh, who can answer him! The people around him, in the end, are just like him.\\n\\nIs it possible that humanity cannot find the clues to life? Or is it because, as Chế Lan Viên saw, the human mind is obscured by countless desires?\\n\\nOnce upon a time, a prince, for the suffering of humanity, for the great questions of humankind, set out to seek the truth. After much effort to eliminate the countless layers of darkness covering the soul, one day, with radiant wisdom, he found the light. That light he shone everywhere. The former doubts and uncertainties were completely extinguished, and when those doubts were entirely extinguished, a complete joy manifested. The transcendent smile on each person became immortal. To this day, countless beings have followed in his footsteps on the path of truth. Following his example, eliminating desire, increasing love, cultivating wisdom, many have found tranquility in their souls, with a single-minded determination toward the horizon of enlightenment. Here, doubts dissolve, truth is realized, and one is completely liberated from all physical and spiritual constraints. The starting point for this journey to the horizon of enlightenment is a legitimate human question.\\n\\nThe remaining Sanskrit scriptures in India were very few during the time of Hodgson and Wright, but why were they so abundant in Nepal? We must find the cause.\\n\\nReading the history of India, who does not see the period when Muslim followers invaded Indian territory, destroying other religions? At that time, around the 9th century, Muslims went about burning scriptures, destroying temples, and burning countless Sanskrit scriptures. Buddhist followers, in the spirit of compassion and non-violence, gathered and preserved the remaining scriptures that were not burnt and took them to Nepal for refuge. They stayed there, and because of this, Buddhism quickly spread in the territory of Nepal, and later scholars found the manuscripts there.\\n\\nFollowing Hodgson and Wright, many other French, British, Japanese, and German scholars made efforts to collect Sanskrit scriptures. Among them, we mention Mr. A. Stein, a Briton; Mr. A. Grünwedel, a German; and Mr. P. Pelliot, a Frenchman. These individuals made significant contributions to providing materials for Buddhist studies.\\n\\nThanks to this, the study of Buddhism has now become much easier.\\n\\nGradually, the Buddhist canon was translated into the languages of many countries. From the original Sanskrit, there were translations into Chinese and then Tibetan. Following that, there were translations into Mongolian, Manchu, and Japanese. Among these translations, the Mongolian and Manchu versions are retranslations, while the Japanese version, although translated directly from Sanskrit, contains many scriptures retranslated from Chinese.\\n\\nComparing these translations, we find that the Chinese version is the most perfect. In terms of quantity, the Chinese version is already superior. Regarding linguistic aspects, the Chinese language is rich and exquisite, capable of fully conveying the profound meanings of the original. Western scholars often refer to the Chinese translations. However, sometimes, not fully understanding the Chinese linguistic methods, these scholars make rather amusing mistakes.\\n\\nA French orientalist, Mr. A. Rémusat, in his translation of \"The Record of Buddhist Countries by Faxian,\" published in 1836, translated the phrase \"Khắc ngưu đầu chiên đàn tác Phật tượng\" as carving the image of a cow\\'s head and using sandalwood to make a Buddha statue, not knowing that \"ngưu đầu chiên đàn\" is the name of a type of fragrant wood in India, not a cow\\'s head. The British antiquarian J. Fergusson, based on this translation, claimed that Buddhism worships cow heads, and thus classified Buddhism as one of the lower religions (see \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" published in London in 1868).\\n\\nThe translation of Buddhist scriptures in China was organized methodically. From the time of Emperor Ming of the Later Han to the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, over a span of 1,200 years, the translation endeavor continued steadily. A statistical summary reveals that during this period, there were 194 translators who translated 1,440 Buddhist texts, comprising 5,586 volumes. This long period of translation can be divided into two: the period of old translations and the period of new translations.\\n\\nAmong the representative translators of the old translation period, we must mention Kumarajiva (of the Yao Qin era), An Shigao and Lokaksema (of the Later Han era), Zhi Qian (of the Wu era), Zhu Fahu (of the Western Jin era), Buddhayasha (of the Eastern Jin era), Bodhiruci (of the Northern Wei era), and Paramartha (of the Chen era). Most of these venerable figures were foreign monks from India.\\n\\nIn the new translation period, the most famous was the monk Xuanzang. He studied in India for 17 years, mastering Indian languages and deeply understanding Buddhist scriptures. Upon returning to his country, the monk adopted a new translation method, striving to convey the meanings of the original texts, and opened a new era in the history of Chinese translation. After Xuanzang, there were monks such as Yijing, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra... each contributing uniquely. This period was when the Chinese monks took the lead in translations.\\n\\nOver the ages, these translation works became increasingly rich. To prevent loss, many scholars thought of making catalogs of these works. Furthermore, the Chinese highly valued literary records, so they were very concerned with cataloging these translated works. Since Dao An of the Eastern Jin era compiled the general catalog of scriptures, there have been nearly 60 catalogs. Today, twenty remain. This is indeed a wealth of knowledge!\\n\\nAmong them, the most complete is the \"Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu\" by Zhisheng, composed in the 28th year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang dynasty (730 A.D.). In this work, the division and history of translations from various eras are clearly discussed, making it an essential guide for those wishing to study the great canon. According to this book, the existing works consist of 1,076 texts comprising 5,048 volumes. Later generations often considered this number as average and often claimed that the canon contained 5,000 volumes. In reality, the canon does not have a fixed number, as translated works continue to increase.\\n\\nOnce catalogs of the scriptures existed, it became possible to approximately define the scope of the canon. This provided a basis for engraving. By the Tang dynasty, the art of engraving and printing had flourished, so the printing work was carried out. However, a complete engraving of the entire great canon had to wait until the fourth year of the Kaibao era of Emperor Taizu of the Song dynasty to begin and was completed in 983 (in the fifth year of the Taizong Xingguo era). The engraving work continued for 12 years. The great canon was published and soon spread to Japan and Korea. Recently, the Commercial Press in Shanghai has printed the canon using photographic printing (photo printing). In total, there are fourteen editions.\\n\\nDuring the Song dynasty, when the canon was completed, Korea sent for a copy. In 1008, during the 14th year of the Ying Tian era, after Vietnam had reconciled with the Song dynasty, King Lê Đại Hành, hearing about the publication of the great canon in China, sent envoys Minh Xuong and Hoang Thanh Nha to China, offering local products and requesting a copy of the Great Canon. The Song emperor immediately granted it to the Vietnamese envoys.\\n\\nIn 1019, King Lý Thái Tổ also sent envoys Phạm Hạc and Nguyễn Đạo Thanh to China to request the great canon.',\n",

When bestowed by the King of the Song dynasty, a Zen master named Phi Trí was appointed to go all the way to Guangxi to bring it back and display it in the Great Hung library. In Korea, in 1011, King Hiến Tông also ordered the scriptures to be engraved, using the Song version as the original. It took twenty-eight years to complete, but as soon as it was finished, it was destroyed by warfare. In the era of King Cao Tông, in 1236, it was engraved again. This time the engraving process was conducted very carefully, based on various versions, not solely on the Song version as before.

The young musicians were amazed; they had never heard such a beautiful sound. The green forest listened, the sky was calm as if cradled, all beings held their breath, silent. The flute sound traveled through the green leaves, glided over the treetops, then soared high into the sky. The marvelous sound seemed to wrap around the stars Altair and Vega, and at that moment, the wind began to rustle through the trees; the sound of the wind was like whispers, like blessings, like praises... like support, to lift the magical flute sound higher and higher...\\n\\nThe Buddha had put the flute down, yet more than thirty young men were still dazed, their spirits immersed in the lingering sound drifting among the clouds.\\n\\nWhen they returned to reality, they noticed the gentle eyes of the sage calmly gazing at them.\\n\\nAll spoke in unison: “Venerable Teacher!

Scientific laws are established by humans, as long as they align with a large part of the phenomena we observe. No one prohibits a scientist from proposing a law different from Newton\\'s to explain the configuration of the stars. In the realm of physics, laws are often closer to reality, whereas in many other fields like chemistry, laws often have a temporary and hypothetical nature, though they possess great utility. Earlier, I mentioned alignment with a large portion of phenomena to express the relative nature of science. It is relative because that alignment depends on measurements which are never complete. Again, it is relative because scientific laws are only applicable within a certain scope, according to a level. Laws governing phenomena we observe with the naked eye cannot be applied to phenomena we observe with a microscope.\\n\\nThose who have studied thermodynamics surely know the principle that if you place a cold object next to a hot one, the hot object will transfer heat to the cold one until both reach the same temperature. However, those two objects comprise many elements. If examining each element like in the kinetic theory of matter, then the aforementioned Carnot principle becomes invalid: heat at that point no longer has practical meaning and one explains heat by the movement of agitating molecules (quantité de mouvement des molécules en agitation). If two objects placed together consist of a very small number of elements, the exchange of kinetic energy might not be balanced to make both objects reach the same temperature. This is considered from a rigorous theoretical perspective; in practice, an object always contains countless elements: thus, when two objects of different temperatures are placed close, the temperatures always equalize - Because according to the law of probability, this is the most likely case. The Carnot theory, though not absolute, is still applied in many cases.\\n\\nBecause it is a free creation, suitable at each level, it is not surprising that in the evolutionary history of science, many new theories overthrow old ones. Overthrowing here does not mean completely abandoning but means advancing to a higher point of view than the previous one, like leaving a low hill to climb a high mountain, encompassing a broader scene. An example to clarify the meaning: Scientists observe light phenomena. Among those phenomena, they establish a connection called the theory of light traveling in straight lines (théorie de la propagation rectiligne). Whether this is true or not, scientists do not need to know nor can they know. What they need is for the theory to help them encompass and explain many light phenomena (lenses, prisms, etc.). But there are several phenomena like diffraction that cannot be explained with the straight-line theory. Therefore, scientists developed the wave theory (théorie vibratoire) of light, in which light propagates like waves. This theory is broader but more complicated and cannot explain many complex phenomena. Nowadays, the electromagnetic theory (théorie électromagnétique) of light occupies a dominant position, explaining many phenomena and linking optics with electricity and thermodynamics. However, this does not mean the electromagnetic theory has overthrown or killed the other two theories. When necessary, we still study and utilize them. This is because those theories are simpler in explanation than the electromagnetic theory. And while the electromagnetic theory is higher and broader, it still has flaws because it is a free creation of scientists like the other two theories, meaning it has not reached absolute truth. From a fundamental perspective, all three have equal value, so using any theory is not a concern, as long as it yields good results in the current scope.\\n\\nThough a free creation with a relative nature, science is always based on experiments. No matter how promising a theory is, if it is not verified by experiments, scientists must reject it. Similarly, they abandon their theories to follow broader and richer ones. This means a genuine scientist must set aside emotions, pride, and focus only on pursuing objective truth as mentioned above. They do not hesitate because of existing societal prejudices or human pride, failing to place humanity in its true position in the universe. Due to this objective, fair view, science, over centuries, has been hindered by intellectual prejudices, especially by monotheistic religions, preventing its development. Only when scientists abandoned the egocentric view that humans are the center of the Earth, and the Earth is the center of the universe, did science evolve powerfully.\\n\\nThe above provides a brief overview of essential knowledge about science. Now that you understand the main ideas, let us address the most significant issue: the connection between Buddhism and Science. Significant, but it will be brief because, as we have said, it is merely a provisional means. Naturally, we should not criticize science when we have faith and understand causality, seeing that science in itself has no faults. We should not rely on minor details to force Buddhism into science because as science advances, these aspects will continually change. However, we may take scientific discoveries to bring listeners closer to Buddhism. For instance, when the Buddha speaks of the nature of the four great elements pervading the Dharma realm, someone knowledgeable in science would not be surprised; or when saying this body is not us, those who know science will easily accept. Nonetheless, these are aspects to use sparingly, as frequent use can easily lead to errors when we are not truly knowledgeable in both Buddhism and science. Each term and principle in science has a definite meaning, and without clarity, it is easy to misunderstand.\\n\\nHence, when teaching the Dharma and mentioning science, I believe fellow practitioners should speak from a general perspective, relying on the common characteristics as discussed above.\\n\\nWhat is most noteworthy is that science, like Buddhism, values truth highly, regardless of whether that truth is agreeable or not, or whether it contradicts our familiar understanding. To the scientist, humans are merely phenomena among many, with no prejudice about ranking between humans and animals when seeking knowledge. Buddhism is the same. Buddhism considers humans as merely sentient beings, and this world is just one among countless, infinite worlds. Because it does not regard existing prejudices of humans, science helps us consider the unimaginable aspects of Buddhism. Accustomed to the rigorous discipline of science, not hastily judging, accepting, or rejecting until\\n\\ncalmly hearing Buddhist principles,\\n\\nexamining carefully, we shall\\n\\nnot let its contradiction with our learning\\n\\nlead to hastily dismissing or criticizing it.\\n\\nOnly those who seek the path in this way, with earnestness but not overly rash or misguided enthusiasm, can understand and believe in Buddhism. If we are knowledgeable in science, when hearing Buddhism say life is suffering, or that humans must undergo rebirth, we will not react like those who are sentimental or prejudiced, quickly deeming it pessimistic or illogical. Saying so, with very illogical reasoning: \"If life is suffering, then it’s easy to become disillusioned with life, if there is rebirth, how could we become oxen or dogs?\" please, fellow practitioners, remember\\n\\nto encompass\\n\\nIn fundamental principles\\n\\nare foundational principles, not detailed minutiae. Science\\n\\nrelies on the law of causality to explore the laws connecting phenomena in the universe. Buddhism is the same. Generally and broadly, Buddhism says if there is cause, there is effect. But saying effect is simply talking about a general aspect concerning the life of sentient beings. If precisely stated, it should be called dependent origination. And in the dependent origination of the nature of the Dharma realm, is there a Dharma that doesn’t relate to another? Therefore, speaking of causality is but a small part of a grand universal principle encompassing the universe. Thus, causality in that sense is only relative, only partially true, not absolutely true. Science also acknowledges this. The laws they create are only true within a certain scope, as the phenomena they observe cannot be isolated at will. There are countless influences affecting the phenomena they observe, which they must ignore, countless experimental errors they cannot avoid. This notion of relativity in science can bring us closer to understanding Buddhism, because within the wondrous function of the true mind, all Dharmas manifest. Is there any Dharma that is independently established, any Dharma that doesn’t relate to all other Dharmas?\\n\\nEven though material phenomena are relative, with myriad forms and shapes, scientists still intend to find a common connection for all those phenomena, aiming towards the objective truth as defined earlier. Thus, they dissect matter to the utmost, and today, theory and experiment have proven that matter and energy consist of the subtlest particles, electrons or photons (électron, photon). The matter we see, even light, heat, and electricity we use, all share a common foundation. Although the connection is somewhat temporary, we can say: this helps us acknowledge the Buddhist concept that all Dharmas are one true mind.\\n\\nIn the book \"Buddhism for Beginners,\" we have shown that the method of scientific inquiry resembles the practice methods of Buddhist practitioners.',\n",
       " 's:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:11': 'Beginning with discipline: eliminate anything that might hinder or obstruct our observation. Next is concentration: focus on the task without letting the mind stray from the subject under study. Finally, wisdom: through concentration, one discovers a principle, illuminating the phenomenon, connecting disparate results into a harmonious system (see the section on Buddhism and science in Basic Buddhism).\\n\\nTo conclude these comparisons, I think we should draw attention to a connection that I consider the most significant. Science represents a particular state of the human mind\\'s desire to know, to know clearly, to know to the extreme, even if it means conflicting with nature, even if it means enduring bitterness and suffering. For that knowledge has revealed to us the humble position of humanity in the universe. The overly developed knowledge that focuses on material objects, with an objective perspective, has caused many superior minds to feel the need to balance it with some emotion, some faith, some compassion. Then, from one extreme to the other — as often happens, many people tend toward emotion and turn to criticize reason, praising religious faith while condemning science. But religions that focus only on emotion, only advocating love, fall into the pitfall of making people easily superstitious, and because of superstition and ignorance, they harm people under the guise of compassion. This is not surprising. Religious wars are proof of the harmfulness of such bias. Buddhism cannot, because Buddhism encompasses both compassion and wisdom. Love but know why we love, how to truly love. Wisdom and compassion always go hand in hand in Buddhism, regardless of the level or method of practice. The benefit of science for us Buddhists may be to demonstrate the importance of understanding so that we can further clarify the importance of wisdom in Buddhism.\\n\\nViên Đình\\n\\nVietnamese Buddhism\\n\\nThe ascetic years had passed. One day, unexpectedly, the Prince felt weary. He looked back at his body and saw himself emaciated: His body was thin and frail, merely skin wrapped over bones. The strong force of his spirit had sustained his body to some extent, but because of his intense focus on practice, he had neglected to nourish his physical form.\\n\\nFormerly, he had opposed the ascetics. Now he had unintentionally followed their path. So, he stood up and went to the riverbank of the Nairanjana.\\n\\nHowever, being too weak, he collapsed under a tree. A shepherdess passing by saw him and quickly ran over to offer him a bowl of milk.\\n\\nHe received it and felt invigorated; all his noble signs reappeared as before. The shepherdess, astonished, thought he was a deity and knelt at a distance with folded hands in reverence.\\n\\nHe gestured for the shepherdess to come closer and pour him a second bowl of milk. The shepherdess remained bowed.\\n\\n“Please, my Lord, you are a divine being, and I am but a humble Brahmin. I dare not approach you.”\\n\\nThe gentle Prince replied, “Do not be afraid, come here and pour me another cup. I am no divine being, just an ordinary person. I do not differentiate between my noble lineage and your Brahmin lineage. You are a person, just like me. There cannot be a class division separating one person from another, nor can there be distinctions of noble and humble among those who share the same blood.”\\n\\nThe shepherdess joyfully came closer and poured milk for him.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, the villagers near the forest heard of this, and at noon, they brought milk, honey, and other food offerings. He accepted them equally, nourishing his body to restore the balance and harmony between body and spirit, then resumed his contemplation as before.\\n\\nOne day, a servant of Lady Sujata went into the forest and, passing by, saw Him sitting majestically under a tree glowing with radiant light. Astonished, he hurried back to report to his mistress.\\n\\nLady Sujata, upon hearing this, immediately recognized it as a good omen, indicating that the one sitting under the tree was near enlightenment. She ordered her servants to prepare a golden bowl with fragrant milk and personally offered it.\\n\\nUpon nearing him, seeing the radiant light emanating from the Prince\\'s face, Lady Sujata was filled with awe and knelt down, saying:\\n\\n\"I have come to offer milk in this golden bowl, may you be pleased to accept it.\"\\n\\nWithout daring to look, she reverently placed the golden bowl before the Prince and returned home, her heart elated.\\n\\nAfter the prince finished his repast, he took the golden bowl and walked towards the Nairanjana River. He tossed the golden bowl into the river, saying:\\n\\n\"If I am to attain Buddhahood, then this golden bowl must float on the surface and flow upstream against the current.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he spoke, the golden bowl rose to the surface and swiftly floated against the current.\\n\\nThe prince entered the river to bathe. He emerged with a refreshed spirit. A voice within seemed to encourage him, saying that just a little more effort to overcome the final difficult passage would lead him to enlightenment.\\n\\nA young shepherd passed by, carrying four bundles of grass on his back. Seeing the Prince, the boy felt a surge of joy within. He placed the four bundles of grass and his sickle on the ground, bowed with folded hands, and said:\\n\\n\"I have nothing but a sickle and four bundles of grass, I don\\'t know what to offer you.\"\\n\\nThe gentle Prince replied, \"If you wish, you may offer me one of those young bundles of grass.\"\\n\\nThe boy happily placed a bundle of grass in the Prince\\'s hands and saluted him.\\n\\nThe Prince took the bundle, spread its contents beneath a large bodhi tree, its lush green leaves providing shade over a wide area.\\n\\nGazing at the blue sky, the green mountains, then at the bodhi tree, and down at the grass mat he had just laid out, the Prince declared:\\n\\n\"Though my flesh and bones may waste away, though my body may be exhausted, I shall not leave this Bodhi tree until I have found the Way.\"\\n\\nWith that, he calmly sat down in the lotus position, crossing his legs.\\n\\nThat night was the seventh night of the lunar month. Although the crescent moon had just risen and set by the second watch, the thousands of stars were unusually bright.\\n\\nThe Prince was immersed in deep meditation.\\n\\nThe power of his concentration shone with a radiant halo lighting up the Bodhi seat.\\n\\nThe world trembled with vibrations heralding the Moment of Enlightenment. Mara, the Evil One, realizing that defeat was imminent due to the radiant light of Enlightenment, hurried to the Bodhi tree.\\n\\n\"You there,\" Mara said, pointing at the Prince, \"how much light do you have that you dare to aspire to illuminate the path for humanity?\"\\n\\nTurning away, Mara showed the Prince the pitch-black four corners of the sky, with all the stars obscured by clouds.\\n\\nThe Prince did not respond. A beam of light from his forehead swept away all the clouds, and the sky returned to its clear state, with stars twinkling brightly.\\n\\nMara angrily shouted, \"What do you intend to do with your light?\"\\n\\n\"I will use the light of my Way to guide sentient beings, leading all creatures out of the darkness of ignorance to liberation.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, liberation for all beings! I see you have no hope of accomplishing that.\"\\n\\n\"I will achieve that.\"\\n\\n\"Who will testify to your words?\"\\n\\nThe Prince pointed to the earth. \"The earth shall bear witness to my words.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he finished speaking, the earth trembled. The Earth Deity appeared, scattering flowers in offering to the Prince and glaring at Mara, forcing him to retreat.\\n\\nThe Prince remained silent in meditation, his mind and body rejuvenated.\\n\\nBy the fourth watch, when the Prince had just attained the knowledge of past lives, seeing clearly all his previous existences, Mara returned.\\n\\nHe assumed the form of the beautiful Lady Yasodhara, accompanied by the most charming maidens from the royal palace, who had once served the Prince.\\n\\nWith a mournful beauty, the false Yasodhara approached the Prince, weeping and pleading for him to return.\\n\\nThe serene Prince replied, \"Those illusions of desire can no longer tempt me.\"\\n\\nMara, infuriated, cried out, summoning all the evil spirits to unleash thunder, lightning, storms, and shoot countless poison arrows at the Prince.\\n\\nBut the Prince remained seated on his grass seat, and no arrow could reach him.\\n\\nAt the end of the fourth watch, the storm subsided, and Mara was defeated.\\n\\nAt the beginning of the fifth watch, the Prince attained the knowledge of the cessation of mental defilements, eliminating all subtle afflictions of the mind.\\n\\nWhen the morning star rose, he sat silently beneath the Bodhi tree, deep in meditation. He communicated with the bodhisattvas, expounding the truth he had just realized.\\n\\nBy the end of the third week, when he emerged from his meditation, the heavenly king Indra and the deities came, requesting him to turn the Dharma wheel and spread the teachings of Enlightenment in the world.\\n\\nThe Great Enlightened One lifted Indra, saying, \"Heavenly King, there is no need for you to request. I have never forgotten my deepest aspiration to alleviate the suffering of beings.

An Italian monk, who has practiced in Myanmar for over a\\n\\ndecade, mentioned that there are a few who have attained\\n\\nArahantship in Myanmar.\\n\\nOn the sixth day, June 1st, we returned to Thailand.\\n\\nHaving received prior notice, the Vietnamese ambassador in Thailand\\n\\nsent someone to welcome us to the embassy for rest. The next morning,\\n\\nupon inquiring about our flight back to Saigon, we found out that the\\n\\nflight was not until the following Tuesday. Thanks to this delay, we\\n\\nhad the opportunity to stay in Bangkok for four days. The ambassador\\n\\ninvited Thầy Bích-Vân from Huế, residing at the Vietnamese Pagoda,\\n\\nand Thầy Huệ-Lực from Vĩnh Long, residing at the Thai Pagoda, to\\n\\nvisit us and relieve our boredom. Meeting fellow compatriots on foreign\\n\\nsoil, we joyfully took each other to visit Vietnamese temples and\\n\\nfamous sites in Thailand.\\n\\nIn the capital, Bangkok, there are seven Vietnamese temples,\\n\\neach beautiful and prosperous, as many Chinese merchants reside here,\\n\\noffering generous donations. Among the seven Vietnamese temples,\\n\\nthere are:\\n\\nThe Phổ Temple, built by Vietnamese during the reign of\\n\\nKing Gia Long. Master Hòa Hải from Huế, who resides here,\\n\\nis renowned for alms collection, not holding ceremonies,\\n\\nbut focusing on meditation, reciting mantras, and healing.\\n\\nThe Quảng Phước Temple (Túy Ngạn) of Thầy Bích Vân.\\n\\nThis temple thrives due to its patronage; the teacher frequently\\n\\nperforms ceremonies and offerings.\\nThe Cảnh Phước Temple of Thầy Yết-Ma Bữu Ân, who\\n\\nhas resided here for over 20 years. The teacher constructed a\\n\\nlarge main hall with a ceramic pagoda at the back. The monks\\'\\n\\nquarters are beautifully situated behind the garden. Next to\\n\\nthe temple garden stands a building with two crematoriums\\n\\non the upper floor and two lavish wings for storing banners\\n\\nand hosting funeral guests. The bodies of the poor and children\\n\\nare cremated and their ashes scattered around the garden\\n\\nwithout burial. Only the wealthy and monks take a handful\\n\\nof ashes for interment in the pagoda. The wealthy donate\\n\\ngenerously to the temple, sometimes up to a thousand or more,\\n\\ncontributing to the temple\\'s prosperity and prominence.\\n\\nIn Thailand, there are no overpopulated graveyards as in Vietnam.\\n\\nThailand has a population of 18 million,\\n\\nwith 10 million being Chinese, 9 million naturalized as Thais,\\n\\nand about 1 million pure Teochew. There are about 80,000\\n\\nVietnamese expatriates, with 30,000 naturalized and 50,000\\n\\nretaining Vietnamese citizenship.\\n\\nAccording to Thai customs, when a boy comes of age or starts a\\n\\nfamily, he must enter a temple for at least three months. If he\\n\\nwishes to become a monk, he must first arrange his family\\'s affairs,\\n\\nentrusting them to his wife and children, before entering the temple\\n\\nto receive the novice precepts and later the full monastic precepts.\\n\\nUpon fulfilling his vow, he renounces the precepts and returns home.\\n\\nThose who spend extended periods in monastic life are more trusted\\n\\nby the public in social roles.\\n\\nWomen ordain only for a limited period. Between the ages of 15\\n\\nand 17, they enter the temple to receive novice precepts, providing\\n\\ntheir own sustenance, and wear white attire, practicing for as long\\n\\nas they wish. Upon completing their vow, they return to secular life,\\n\\nunlike nuns in Japan, China, or Vietnam who may practice lifelong monasticism.\\n\\nOn Sunday, June 3rd, Thầy Huệ Lực from Vĩnh Long, who has\\n\\nstudied in Thailand for six years, took us to see the Emerald Buddhist\\n\\nTemple. This temple is situated in front of the royal palace. Around\\n\\nthe temple courtyard, the walls depict the Buddha\\'s history, each side\\n\\nmeasuring over 100 meters.\\n\\nIn the center stands a large shrine housing a green jade Buddha\\n\\naround one meter tall, truly magnificent. This temple opens its doors\\n\\nevery Sunday afternoon for visitors, without chanting services.\\n\\nVisitors with cameras must pay 5 ticos for permission to take photos.\\n\\nThe temple spans about one hectare, with overlapping towers,\\n\\noffering a breathtaking view. Surrounding the outer walls, each side\\n\\nstretches approximately 200 meters.\\n\\nAcross the street lies Wat Phô Temple, truly grand. Around the\\n\\ncourtyard, numerous bronze Buddha statues are placed. Inside the\\n\\ntemple rests a reclining Buddha on a one-meter-high platform. The\\n\\nBuddha statue measures 46 meters long, from the supporting arm to the\\n\\nfurthest point over ten meters, the head five meters, and the two feet\\n\\nstacked three meters high. The entire statue is gilded, shining brilliantly.\\n\\nVisitors, both local and international, come to admire this splendid\\n\\nand unique sculpture.\\n\\nWe also visited the Trimitr Temple, which enshrines a seated\\n\\nBuddha statue made of gold weighing about 5 tons, with\\n\\nthe pinnacle on the Buddha\\'s head weighing over 45 kilograms.\\n\\nSix hundred years ago, during the reign of a king,\\n\\nthis statue was cast in nine parts. When the statue was completed,\\n\\nduring a Burmese invasion, the king, fearing theft, ordered it to be\\n\\ncovered with a layer of clay to conceal its value. Over time, people\\n\\nbelieved it to be a clay Buddha. One day, while the monks at Trimitr\\n\\nTemple were moving it, a strap scratched the clay on the Buddha\\'s arm,\\n\\nrevealing the gold beneath. The outer clay was removed,\\n\\nand the gold shone once more. Due to its immense value,\\n\\na new temple was constructed to house it. At this new temple,\\n\\nguards vigilantly watch over it day and night.\\n\\nMany visitors come to worship, donate, and admire.\\n\\nTruly, a remarkable tale.\\n\\nWe then visited Wat In Temple, featuring a standing Buddha\\n\\naround 20 meters tall.',\n",

Behind the statue, a staircase has been constructed with an iron railing, spiraling up to the height of the Buddha's head.\\n\\nTruly, this is an unparalleled figure standing majestically, a model for sentient beings to abandon evil deeds for countless ages. I stood gazing endlessly, never tiring, until the moment of departure.\\n\\nWe then arrived at the Golden Mountain. This is a small rock mountain located in the middle of the city, about 50 meters high. Near the top, there is a gourd made of gold, which is why it is called the Golden Mountain. This mountain lies behind a Thai temple where stairs have been built to reach the top of the mountain. The project took six years to complete.\\n\\nWe arrived on the day of its inauguration; throngs of faithful gathered to offer their respects at the stupa, coming and going like a bustling fair.\\n\\nDuring this ceremony, from the temple gate to the foot of the mountain, the area was crowded with stalls. Vendors sold incense and candles along with a golden leaf already inscribed; before ascending the mountain, everyone had to take a golden leaf and incense stick. Upon entering the stupa, they would plant the incense as an offering, while the golden leaf was placed on the bronze stupa within the peak of the stupa.\\n\\nStanding atop the stupa and looking down, the vast and splendid city of Bangkok unfolds before the eyes. As we descended, we realized that the monk who envisioned the construction of the stupa on this mountain was truly wise, wishing for all future generations to enjoy moments of peace.\\n\\nThe capital city of Bangkok in Thailand is not much different from our own city of Saigon, except for the grand and magnificent temples and stupas here, a scale that Vietnam has yet to achieve even one-tenth of.\\n\\nOn the third day, we prepared to leave, with the Ambassador sending two staff members to accompany us to the Bangkok airport train station.\\n\\nReturning from India, India, Burma, and Thailand, after witnessing the Buddhism of these neighboring countries, I cannot help but feel wistful when reflecting on the Buddhism of our homeland. I hope that, should favorable conditions arise, with more complete methods, Vietnamese Buddhism will expand more vigorously and reach a splendid and glorious state like these countries.\\n\\nI fervently wish that this aspiration will be realized in the future, placing all my trust in the current generations of followers.\\n\\nVIETNAMESE BUDDHISM\\n\\nT.T.H\",\n",

Previously, this house was a library filled with scriptures and paintings, but due to the ravages of war, currently, only a collection of scriptures and a few remaining texts exist.

This charming house is reserved for the venerable teachers, while the novices reside in two rooms of the guest house.\\n\\nVI. Looking to the Past\\nWithout close observation, one might mistakenly think Tu Dam is a completely new pagoda, but the faded sign in front of the Buddha hall reveals that the pagoda\\'s original name was An-Ton, built during the Le Dynasty in the year Quy Ti (1683), during the time of the Northern and Southern conflicts. In the first year of Emperor Thieu Tri, it was renamed Tu Dam Pagoda (as inscribed on the sign at the Ancestral House).\\nThe pagoda was established by Venerable Minh-Hoang Tu Dung. He was a native of Guangdong, China, invited by Venerable Nguyen Thieu under the order of Lord Nguyen Phuc Trang (1687-1691), also known as Lord Anh Ton, to come to Vietnam. After transmitting precepts to the Sangha at Linh Mu Pagoda with Venerables Thach Liem, Minh-Vat, Minh Hai, etc., he stayed in Hue to cultivate and teach. He belonged to the third generation of the Lam Te lineage.\\nHe was a person of both virtue and talent. He transmitted the Dharma and certified Venerable Lieu Quan, a Vietnamese, who became the first Zen patriarch in Central and Southern Vietnam.\\n\\nVII. Its Historical Role\\nTu Dam Pagoda not only serves as a place of worship and study for Buddhist followers but also plays a significant role in the evolutionary history of the Vietnamese nation.\\nIn the era of the Northern and Southern conflicts, Hue was a new land: all political and religious sectors were still in their infancy, and the majority of the population, newly emigrated from the North, along with a number of assimilated Cham people, lacked a stable place to establish their livelihoods and a true spiritual belief for their mental life.\\nThis pagoda, along with Venerable Tu Dung, as well as Quoc An Pagoda with Venerable Nguyen Thieu, Linh Mu Pagoda with Venerable Thach Liem, etc., accomplished these tasks.\\nThrough numerous changes: the pagoda was repaired many times, old people passed on, and new ones succeeded; the venerables Thuc Vinh, Sat Ngu, Dao Trung, Thanh Dong, etc., continued this sacred mission.\\nBy 1936, the pagoda was entrusted by the Buddhist Congregation to the Buddhist Studies Association to serve as a center for spreading the Dharma. As the Buddhist Studies movement grew, the role of this pagoda became increasingly important. It not only served as a place of worship and study for a number of nearby Buddhists in Hue, but it also...',\n",

Or because we lack the spirit of harmony? Or is it that we are not very passionate about the work of unification?\\n\\nIn the declaration of the establishment of the General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism, announced in 1951, the Buddhist delegates nationwide earnestly called:\\n\\n\"Oh, all Vietnamese Buddhists, let us level the differences, unite in heart and mind to fulfill the mission of creating peace, sowing the seeds of joy, and raising high the torch of wisdom of the Blessed One.\"\\n\\nThe echo of that heartfelt call still resonates in our souls. The foundation has been laid. Buddhists nationwide joyfully welcomed the day of Unified Buddhism. The unification movement gained strength, and everywhere, the resounding songs of young Buddhists praised that great endeavor of unity:\\n\\n\"Vietnamese Buddhism unifies North, South, Central from now on.\\n\\nWith one heart, we advance for the sacred path!\\n\\nLet us rejoice in the radiant golden light of the Dharma, shining in all directions.\\n\\nResounding songs welcome Vietnamese Buddhism...\"\\n\\nThe Buddhist community has passionately embraced the unification movement, yearning for unification, demanding unification.\\n\\nThat alone is enough to prove that the work of unification can indeed be fully realized. The Buddhist masses have never harbored distinctions between one Buddhist organization and another. Consider the event of the Relic Procession years ago in the capital, which stands as compelling evidence; all the various Buddhist organizations in the South joined forces to organize a grand and solemn ceremony. A sea of people with tens of thousands of Buddhist flags created an unprecedented jubilant atmosphere in the capital, and Dr. Malalasekera, president of the world Buddhist organization, did not withhold words of praise upon witnessing the spectacle.\\n\\nThus, we cannot say that Vietnamese Buddhists lack the spirit of harmony, nor can we say that we are not very passionate about the work of unification.\\n\\nSo why is it that, to this day, besides the General Association, there are still other groups operating independently?\\n\\nClearly, it is due to a lack of mutual understanding and knowledge among the Buddhist groups within and outside the General Association. The six groups within the General Association of Buddhism, during the second congress in the capital Saigon, outlined a program of unification...', align=None), Span(aid='p:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:5', page=5, vi='', en='Buddhists, have contributed to the collective construction\\n\\nproviding a firm foundation for Vietnamese Buddhism.

Yet, the atmosphere of the capital at the\\n\\nsecond congress was perhaps not as vibrant as the people\\'s hopes,\\n\\nbecause there remained many other Buddhist groups\\n\\nobserving the congress with an objective, almost\\n\\ncool demeanor.\\n\\nThe General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism must open its arms wide to invite\\n\\nfellow Buddhist groups. The General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism must\\n\\nbe the great family of all Vietnamese Buddhists. In reality,\\n\\nto achieve this modern unity, the groups within the General Association must first\\n\\ndemonstrate deep understanding and must always avoid anything that could\\n\\ncause misunderstanding or harm the foundation of unity. The groups outside the General Association,\\n\\namong them the original Buddhist group, must also\\n\\nacknowledge that the realization of \"harmony\" is the most urgent and\\n\\nimportant task in the current stage.

Whether\\n\\nmerit or fault lies with us depends on whether we are wise and sincere in building unity.\\n\\nMay you be wise to avoid the traps and schemes of the external forces\\n\\nseeking to destroy the true Dharma and obstruct the unified Buddhist foundation.\\n\\nP. G.\\n\\nMillions of eyes are focused on you.\\n\\nProve yourselves worthy as enlightened leaders\\n\\nso as not to let down the hopes of all our Vietnamese Buddhists.\\n\\nIs Buddhism\\n\\na religion or not? Many have asked this question, considering it\\n\\nimportant. In truth,\\n\\nthis question is not very important.\\n\\nWhether we call Buddhism\\n\\na religion, a philosophy,\\n\\nor even a science,\\n\\nBuddhism remains Buddhism,\\n\\nunchanged.\\n\\nBefore me is a Buddhist dictionary.\\n\\nI say: I see the dictionary. If someone asks\\n\\nhow I can see the dictionary, I will answer that\\n\\nI have eyes.\\n\\n• Because I have eyes * this answer is correct, not wrong. But\\n\\nto say it is wholly correct is insufficient, because\\n\\nbesides the eyes, many other conditions are needed:\\n\\nlight, space,\\n\\nvisual consciousness, mental consciousness, etc.\\n\\nThus, stating that Buddhism is\\n\\na religion, or stating that * Buddhism\\n\\nis a philosophy, are both correct.\\n\\nBut not entirely correct. The reason is\\n\\nwhen we speak thus, we are only viewing one\\n\\naspect of Buddhism.\\n\\nHowever, even standing on the aspect\\n\\nof belief, we can examine and determine whether Buddhism\\n\\nis compatible with the spirit of democracy.\\n\\nThe thought of Auguste Comte can\\n\\nrepresent the philosophical thought of the late nineteenth and\\n\\nearly twentieth centuries before the\\n\\nEuropean wars. Comte affirmed the\\n\\nprogressive nature of human thought, and\\n\\nbased on that, he divided the history\\n\\nof human thought into three periods:\\n\\nThe period of religion, that\\n\\nis the ancient period.\\nThe period of philosophy, from the\\n\\nbeginning of the sixteenth century to the beginning of the\\n\\nnineteenth century.\\nThe period of science, from\\n\\nthe nineteenth century onwards.\\n\\nThe period of religion is the period of superstition.\\n\\nThe period of philosophy is the period of idealism.\\n\\nThe period of science is the period of empirical\\n\\nexperiment. This is roughly Comte\\'s categorization.\\n\\nWe see this categorization\\n\\nas still ambiguous and not without errors.\\n\\nTo claim religion, philosophy, and\\n\\nscience represent three periods\\n\\nis quite an awkward endeavor. Humanity in the first period\\n\\n—the period of religion, according to Comte—\\n\\ndid they not have philosophical and scientific thoughts?\\n\\nHumanity in the second period—the period of philosophy—\\n\\ndid they not have religious and philosophical thoughts?\\n\\nThus, this categorization\\n\\nis somewhat mechanical, and this\\n\\nis the major error of the French philosopher.\\n\\nReligion, philosophy, and science are\\n\\nconcrete manifestations of human thought. Each has its own\\n\\nprogressive trajectory, its own origin.\\n\\nAuguste Comte only saw\\n\\nthat these three have dynamics, evolution,\\n\\nbut he could not see\\n\\ntheir true nature.\\n\\nIn ancient times, religious thought\\n\\nwas still immature and naive; during this period,\\n\\nthere arose both immature philosophical reasoning, erroneous and\\n\\nnot concrete. At the same time,\\n\\nscience also emerged: developing tools, utensils for practical human usage,\\n\\nharnessing water power to pound rice, discovering fire...\\n\\nall are initial achievements of science. Although these\\n\\nare not the ages of airplanes, cannons, and atoms,\\n\\nwithout the naïve and rudimentary stages, there would be no age of mature\\n\\nsophistication.\\n\\nFrom the nineteenth century to the present, science\\n\\nhas advanced rapidly and remarkably: philosophy and religion\\n\\nhave followed and made progress. Currently, Western philosophy,\\n\\ndue to new influences,\\n\\nhas begun to be constructed on a scientific foundation,\\n\\nand has resolved many new issues.\\n\\nReligion has the aspiration to resolve\\n\\nthe origins of the universe and human life,\\n\\nbut it always needs faith\\n\\nfirst and foremost. Philosophy also seeks to have\\n\\na comprehensive vision like religion,\\n\\nbut desires to be impartial. Science,\\n\\nin turn, is a detailed examination.\\n\\nNot building upon faith,\\n\\nphilosophy must continually rely\\n\\non experimentation to find a firm\\n\\nstand. Therefore, philosophy\\n\\nplays the role of synthesis, it is the result\\n\\nof harmonizing both science and religion.\\n\\nThus, philosophy has denounced\\n\\nmisguided superstitious religions and supported\\n\\ngenuine religions, suitable with the level\\n\\nof civilization of contemporary society.\\n\\nStanding between religion and science, sometimes\\n\\nphilosophy explains things\\n\\nthat science has not yet comprehended. Though\\n\\nstill within the realm of ideals,\\n\\nsuch things could be future discoveries\\n\\nof empirical science.\\n\\nThrough the investigation of beliefs\\n\\nand guiding discoveries,\\n\\nphilosophy is also called a stimulating factor\\n\\nfor religion and science.\\n\\nThe welfare of society depends greatly\\n\\non human concepts of all three\\n\\naspects: religion, science,\\n\\nand philosophy. Many people do not understand\\n\\nthis, yet believe that society only\\n\\nneeds empirical science.\\n\\nThis bias is a consequence of\\n\\nthe influence of Comte\\'s three-stage theory.\\n\\nBelieving that religion is a representative\\n\\nof human thought in ancient times,\\n\\nunsuitable for today\\'s civilized world,\\n\\nmany advocate\\n\\nthat religion is unnecessary. Some\\n\\npolitical parties even call for\\n\\n\"down with religion,\" creating\\n\\na movement within a chaotic society.\\n\\nIn truth, humanity cannot\\n\\nexist without belief. Reviewing\\n\\nhistory, we see that religion is indeed\\n\\nthe foundation of social cohesion.\\n\\nThe Islamic nation has forbidden its\\n\\npeople from believing in any religion\\n\\nother than Islam, simultaneously\\n\\nusing political power to conquer weaker neighbors. The Communist Party\\n\\nonly trusts in one - the \"unique\" communist ideology, believing firmly\\n\\nin this ideology as if in divinity.\\n\\nUnder the red flag, the center of cohesion\\n\\nis the ideology of Karl Marx. Relying\\n\\non that ideology to mobilize, to\\n\\nconcentrate the thoughts and will of the people, to\\n\\ncomplete the form of\\n\\ncommunist party rule, is akin to promoting a kind\\n\\nof religion: communist religion. Thus,\\n\\nparty society or communist party, even if calling for the downfall\\n\\nof religion, merely seeks to overthrow old religions,\\n\\nto establish a \"new religion\" of their own.\\n\\nUltimately, belief remains\\n\\nvery necessary for the cohesion\\n\\nof society.\\n\\nThus, we have seen the extremely\\n\\nimportant position of belief in\\n\\nconstructing a new society. An erroneous\\n\\nbelief system can create an\\n\\nautocratic society, can lead people\\n\\nto a path of conquest,\\n\\ncausing unwholesome karma. A genuine\\n\\nbelief foundation is needed for people\\n\\nto truly achieve\\n\\ngreat cohesion, a powerful social force,\\n\\nnot directing humanity towards autocracy,\\n\\noppression, conquest.\\n\\nThe cohesive force of humanity\\n\\n—social nature—hence is very necessary\\n\\nfor humanity, but the most concrete and complete\\n\\norganizational condition of society is still the nation.\\n\\nEach nation can be a unit for that\\n\\ngreat cohesive force. Every nation has\\n\\na belief in the universe (cosmology)\\n\\nto serve as the backdrop for its unique\\n\\nview of humanity. Relying\\n\\non cosmic belief, people have\\n\\na human view which is\\n\\nan imitation of the natural world to\\n\\norganize human relations. The ancient\\n\\npolitics of China took the phrase \"following heaven and\\n\\nobserving earth,\" as its foundation for that reason.\\n\\nSociety\\'s customs, religion\\n\\nare all dependent upon the conditions\\n\\nof belief in that cosmology, and\\n\\nhence, the foundation of the nation\\n\\ncan be stable.\\n\\nTherefore, reflection on this,\\n\\nwe see that belief in a cosmology is the point\\n\\nof concentration of thought and will of a nation.\\n\\nNow, discussing the democratic regime,\\n\\nis to speak of a form\\n\\nof political society. Let us examine\\n\\nhow religion relates to social\\n\\nand political organization, then determine\\n\\nwhether Buddhism is compatible\\n\\nwith the spirit of democracy.\\n\\nFrom the perspective of the relationship\\n\\nbetween religion and politics, history\\n\\nof humanity can be divided into three\\n\\nperiods:\\n\\nFirst is the ancient period. This\\n\\nis the age of polytheism. In those times,\\n\\nhuman intellect was still naive,\\n\\nthus in all activities, people always\\n\\nfelt threatened by nature. Hence, humanity\\n\\ndeveloped fear of nature, believing each\\n\\nphenomenon in the universe was governed by\\n\\na divine being: god of wind,\\n\\ngod of rain, god of thunder, god of lightning, god\\n\\nof mountains, god of rivers...\\n\\nFear then led to veneration,\\n\\nbelief, and supplication. Therefore,\\n\\nthat period is called the age of polytheism.\\nAt that time, humans lived in\\n\\ntribes, each tribe led by a\\n\\nchieftain. That political system naturally took\\n\\nthe cosmology of polytheism as its backdrop.\\nHuman intellect gradually expanded.\\n\\nFrom polytheistic belief, humanity advanced to\\n\\nmonotheistic belief, believing that the universe\\n\\nand humanity were created by a supreme\\n\\ndivine being. Though the phenomena of the universe\\n\\nwere diverse and complex, they were all\\n\\nproduced by a single divine.\\n\\nThis is the period of monotheism.\\n\\nPolitics in that era was\\n\\norganized in the form of monarchy.\\n\\nDue to monotheistic cosmology,\\n\\nmonarchical theocratic autocratic forms arose.', align=None)], author=None, summary='This section discusses the challenges and aspirations of unifying the various Buddhist sects in Vietnam.

People have become aware of their own value and rights, leading to collective movements to abolish the monarchy and establish a system of egalitarian democracy. People have gradually realized that the success or failure, prosperity or decline of a nation does not rest in the hands of a king, but in the hands of the entire populace. Each individual, in relation to society and the supreme organization of the nation, must have equivalent duties and enjoy equivalent rights.\\n\\nThe center of unity is where each individual recognizes their duty as a citizen in a democratic nation, comprehends what democracy entails, and practices according to democratic principles. Duties and rights are shared and enjoyed without class distinction, completely equal. The central point is the community spirit of the people. In other words, each individual is a central point.\\n\\nDuring the period when civil rights are expanding, polytheistic and monotheistic beliefs are no longer suitable and naturally cannot sustain themselves. There must be a classless religion, a religion where the truth of equality is promulgated, a religion that affirms the creative and constructive value of each person — to serve as the focal point for the faith of the entire populace, and to be the foundation for the development of individuality and community traits.\\n\\nHere, only Buddhism is worthy.\\n\\nBuddhist philosophy also proposes a cosmology: overthrowing the superstitious cosmology of monotheism and polytheism to establish a cosmology based on interdependent origination.\\n\\nInterdependent origination means the events of mutual relation, mutual causation, and mutual formation. Whether the universe, society, and humanity are good or bad, all are the result of human actions. The bodily, verbal, and mental actions of individuals collectively create a universe, a society. The driving force behind all success, failure, merit, and demerit, good and bad, lies in the individual and collective karma of all beings.\\n\\nThis belief in a cosmology of interdependent origination and collective karma is very suitable with the current social concept of equality. Here, humans are not to submit to deities, but rather see themselves as fully responsible for their own happiness. Such a genuine belief, affirming the value of human duties and rights so firmly, is indeed very fitting with human aspirations and abilities, and ultimately, can serve as the foundation for building a truly democratic society, respecting equality and freedom.\\n\\nA nation that adopts the belief in a cosmology of interdependent origination and collective karma as its backdrop can achieve profound unity and can build a humanistic and virtuous national culture.\\n\\nTherefore, we conclude that Buddhism is the belief that serves as the foundation for building a democratic society.\\n\\nD.

The first type toils throughout the year in the struggle for survival, leaving no time to contemplate the meaning of life. Material deprivation exhausts them, leaving them no free moment. They pour all their thoughts into work, worry, and sorrow due to failure and suffering, and they hardly ever question the meaning of life. Though they might occasionally pause to suddenly realize that life is suffering, thinking that living is to endure pain, such thoughts merely flicker in their minds and then sink into their subconscious. Reality awaits them: where is the time to endlessly ponder the value of life! Thus, they return to work, and until the last moment of their lives, they live and operate like machines, obeying some external, mysterious force.\\n\\nThe second type obeys the call of sensual pleasures daily, immersing themselves in bodily delights, thereby forgetting they are living within a human society. These people, naturally, must possess considerable wealth, whether inherited from parents or obtained through unethical means. Perhaps some among this group intentionally forget life. Why do they wish to forget life? This is easily understood. They have not comprehended life, seen the true value of existence, to claim they have forgotten it! Forgetting life here is just a guise for the bankruptcy of conscience, a statement to cover all that is most vile and rotten in humanity. Forgetting life means wanting no more connection with the world, yet the means used to forget life — money — are still deceitfully exploited within life itself!\\n\\nThe first type deserves our sympathy, if not our compassion. The second type initially evokes our aversion, but in truth, they are even more deserving of pity. Two opposing circumstances sharing the same fate: they are the least living, for they rarely realize they are alive; in other words, they seldom question the true value of life.\\n\\nBut fortunately, these people are few. Let no one be so pessimistic as to believe that all laborers are in the dire situations depicted in *Mother Lê\\'s House* by Thạch Lam or *The Workers Going to Work* by Lan Khai. No! Our country\\'s so-called \"realist\" writers have pushed our imagination too far from reality!\\n\\nLikewise, let no one be so pessimistic as to believe that the moths attracted to the flame of decadence can pollute the current society. We, who are fortunate enough to have a little time to ponder life, recognize that humans cannot live indifferently like plants. We cannot let life drift by with merely eating, sleeping, sleeping, and eating. We must seek something higher than mere sustenance. This tendency to \"seek\" is inherent in us and often keeps us in constant questioning.\\n\\nSometimes, looking up at the vast sky, vast rivers and mountains, and then back at ourselves, we are moved to ask: why is the sky so deep? Why do countless stars twinkle? Where did those mountains and rivers come from? What is our body? Why were we born here?

And before the poet\\'s eyes, the blue sky, the vast sea, the high clouds... Seeing these phenomena, the poet was bewildered, longing to understand. This longing reached a peak, causing the poet to question, to suffer. How tragic it is, when before the earnest questions of a person longing for truth, the universe remains silent, indifferent, and unfeeling, offering no answer:\\n\\nAsking the profound, boundless, and endless scenes,\\n\\nClouds always flying, waves always lapping, wind never stopping\\n\\nAsking if you hear my voice,\\n\\nHear the voice of a suffering soul?\\n\\nI thirst to know the wondrous truth in the universe:\\n\\nBut alas! creation remains silent,\\n\\nFor thousands of years, keeping an indifferent face,\\n\\nAloof, mysterious, and sublime...\\n\\nThe universe remains silent, unwilling to unveil its mysterious veil.

Before us, who were they, and after us, who will they be? Why do we appear in life only to one day disappear, as easily as a drop of water in the vast ocean? The tear of the poet is indeed valuable, worth a thousand gold. It is the tear that springs from a heart filled with deep questioning. A very genuine questioning. Many have cried, and human tears indeed rival the waters of the four great oceans. But most human tears have flowed in the bitterness and suffering of life. How few have been like Trần Tử Ngang, crying for the thirst for truth. That tear truly possesses unparalleled value.\\n\\nIn our souls, impressions of joy and sorrow follow one another through the continuous flow of time.

We must find the cause.\\n\\nReading the history of India, who does not see the period when Muslim followers invaded Indian territory, destroying other religions? At that time, around the 9th century, Muslims went about burning scriptures, destroying temples, and burning countless Sanskrit scriptures. Buddhist followers, in the spirit of compassion and non-violence, gathered and preserved the remaining scriptures that were not burnt and took them to Nepal for refuge. They stayed there, and because of this, Buddhism quickly spread in the territory of Nepal, and later scholars found the manuscripts there.\\n\\nFollowing Hodgson and Wright, many other French, British, Japanese, and German scholars made efforts to collect Sanskrit scriptures. Among them, we mention Mr. A. Stein, a Briton; Mr. A. Grünwedel, a German; and Mr. P. Pelliot, a Frenchman. These individuals made significant contributions to providing materials for Buddhist studies.\\n\\nThanks to this, the study of Buddhism has now become much easier.\\n\\nGradually, the Buddhist canon was translated into the languages of many countries. From the original Sanskrit, there were translations into Chinese and then Tibetan. Following that, there were translations into Mongolian, Manchu, and Japanese. Among these translations, the Mongolian and Manchu versions are retranslations, while the Japanese version, although translated directly from Sanskrit, contains many scriptures retranslated from Chinese.', align=None), Span(aid='p:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:19', page=19, vi='', en='Comparing these translations, we find that the Chinese version is the most perfect. In terms of quantity, the Chinese version is already superior. Regarding linguistic aspects, the Chinese language is rich and exquisite, capable of fully conveying the profound meanings of the original. Western scholars often refer to the Chinese translations. However, sometimes, not fully understanding the Chinese linguistic methods, these scholars make rather amusing mistakes.\\n\\nA French orientalist, Mr. A. Rémusat, in his translation of \"The Record of Buddhist Countries by Faxian,\" published in 1836, translated the phrase \"Khắc ngưu đầu chiên đàn tác Phật tượng\" as carving the image of a cow\\'s head and using sandalwood to make a Buddha statue, not knowing that \"ngưu đầu chiên đàn\" is the name of a type of fragrant wood in India, not a cow\\'s head. The British antiquarian J. Fergusson, based on this translation, claimed that Buddhism worships cow heads, and thus classified Buddhism as one of the lower religions (see \"Tree and Serpent Worship,\" published in London in 1868).\\n\\nThe translation of Buddhist scriptures in China was organized methodically. From the time of Emperor Ming of the Later Han to the beginning of the Yuan dynasty, over a span of 1,200 years, the translation endeavor continued steadily. A statistical summary reveals that during this period, there were 194 translators who translated 1,440 Buddhist texts, comprising 5,586 volumes. This long period of translation can be divided into two: the period of old translations and the period of new translations.\\n\\nAmong the representative translators of the old translation period, we must mention Kumarajiva (of the Yao Qin era), An Shigao and Lokaksema (of the Later Han era), Zhi Qian (of the Wu era), Zhu Fahu (of the Western Jin era), Buddhayasha (of the Eastern Jin era), Bodhiruci (of the Northern Wei era), and Paramartha (of the Chen era). Most of these venerable figures were foreign monks from India.\\n\\nIn the new translation period, the most famous was the monk Xuanzang. He studied in India for 17 years, mastering Indian languages and deeply understanding Buddhist scriptures. Upon returning to his country, the monk adopted a new translation method, striving to convey the meanings of the original texts, and opened a new era in the history of Chinese translation. After Xuanzang, there were monks such as Yijing, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra... each contributing uniquely. This period was when the Chinese monks took the lead in translations.', align=None), Span(aid='p:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:20', page=20, vi='', en='Over the ages, these translation works became increasingly rich. To prevent loss, many scholars thought of making catalogs of these works. Furthermore, the Chinese highly valued literary records, so they were very concerned with cataloging these translated works. Since Dao An of the Eastern Jin era compiled the general catalog of scriptures, there have been nearly 60 catalogs. Today, twenty remain. This is indeed a wealth of knowledge!\\n\\nAmong them, the most complete is the \"Kaiyuan Shijiao Lu\" by Zhisheng, composed in the 28th year of the Kaiyuan era of the Tang dynasty (730 A.D.). In this work, the division and history of translations from various eras are clearly discussed, making it an essential guide for those wishing to study the great canon. According to this book, the existing works consist of 1,076 texts comprising 5,048 volumes. Later generations often considered this number as average and often claimed that the canon contained 5,000 volumes. In reality, the canon does not have a fixed number, as translated works continue to increase.\\n\\nOnce catalogs of the scriptures existed, it became possible to approximately define the scope of the canon. This provided a basis for engraving. By the Tang dynasty, the art of engraving and printing had flourished, so the printing work was carried out. However, a complete engraving of the entire great canon had to wait until the fourth year of the Kaibao era of Emperor Taizu of the Song dynasty to begin and was completed in 983 (in the fifth year of the Taizong Xingguo era). The engraving work continued for 12 years. The great canon was published and soon spread to Japan and Korea. Recently, the Commercial Press in Shanghai has printed the canon using photographic printing (photo printing). In total, there are fourteen editions.\\n\\nDuring the Song dynasty, when the canon was completed, Korea sent for a copy. In 1008, during the 14th year of the Ying Tian era, after Vietnam had reconciled with the Song dynasty, King Lê Đại Hành, hearing about the publication of the great canon in China, sent envoys Minh Xuong and Hoang Thanh Nha to China, offering local products and requesting a copy of the Great Canon.

When bestowed by the King of the Song dynasty, a Zen master named Phi Trí was appointed to go all the way to Guangxi to bring it back and display it in the Great Hung library. In Korea, in 1011, King Hiến Tông also ordered the scriptures to be engraved, using the Song version as the original. It took twenty-eight years to complete, but as soon as it was finished, it was destroyed by warfare. In the era of King Cao Tông, in 1236, it was engraved again.

Scientific laws are established by humans, as long as they align with a large part of the phenomena we observe. No one prohibits a scientist from proposing a law different from Newton's to explain the configuration of the stars. In the realm of physics, laws are often closer to reality, whereas in many other fields like chemistry, laws often have a temporary and hypothetical nature, though they possess great utility. Earlier, I mentioned alignment with a large portion of phenomena to express the relative nature of science. It is relative because that alignment depends on measurements which are never complete. Again, it is relative because scientific laws are only applicable within a certain scope, according to a level. Laws governing phenomena we observe with the naked eye cannot be applied to phenomena we observe with a microscope.\\n\\nThose who have studied thermodynamics surely know the principle that if you place a cold object next to a hot one, the hot object will transfer heat to the cold one until both reach the same temperature. However, those two objects comprise many elements. If examining each element like in the kinetic theory of matter, then the aforementioned Carnot principle becomes invalid: heat at that point no longer has practical meaning and one explains heat by the movement of agitating molecules (quantité de mouvement des molécules en agitation). If two objects placed together consist of a very small number of elements, the exchange of kinetic energy might not be balanced to make both objects reach the same temperature. This is considered from a rigorous theoretical perspective; in practice, an object always contains countless elements: thus, when two objects of different temperatures are placed close, the temperatures always equalize - Because according to the law of probability, this is the most likely case. The Carnot theory, though not absolute, is still applied in many cases.\\n\\nBecause it is a free creation, suitable at each level, it is not surprising that in the evolutionary history of science, many new theories overthrow old ones. Overthrowing here does not mean completely abandoning but means advancing to a higher point of view than the previous one, like leaving a low hill to climb a high mountain, encompassing a broader scene. An example to clarify the meaning: Scientists observe light phenomena. Among those phenomena, they establish a connection called the theory of light traveling in straight lines (théorie de la propagation rectiligne). Whether this is true or not, scientists do not need to know nor can they know. What they need is for the theory to help them encompass and explain many light phenomena (lenses, prisms, etc.). But there are several phenomena like diffraction that cannot be explained with the straight-line theory. Therefore, scientists developed the wave theory (théorie vibratoire) of light, in which light propagates like waves. This theory is broader but more complicated and cannot explain many complex phenomena. Nowadays, the electromagnetic theory (théorie électromagnétique) of light occupies a dominant position, explaining many phenomena and linking optics with electricity and thermodynamics. However, this does not mean the electromagnetic theory has overthrown or killed the other two theories. When necessary, we still study and utilize them. This is because those theories are simpler in explanation than the electromagnetic theory. And while the electromagnetic theory is higher and broader, it still has flaws because it is a free creation of scientists like the other two theories, meaning it has not reached absolute truth. From a fundamental perspective, all three have equal value, so using any theory is not a concern, as long as it yields good results in the current scope.\\n\\nThough a free creation with a relative nature, science is always based on experiments. No matter how promising a theory is, if it is not verified by experiments, scientists must reject it. Similarly, they abandon their theories to follow broader and richer ones. This means a genuine scientist must set aside emotions, pride, and focus only on pursuing objective truth as mentioned above. They do not hesitate because of existing societal prejudices or human pride, failing to place humanity in its true position in the universe. Due to this objective, fair view, science, over centuries, has been hindered by intellectual prejudices, especially by monotheistic religions, preventing its development. Only when scientists abandoned the egocentric view that humans are the center of the Earth, and the Earth is the center of the universe, did science evolve powerfully.\\n\\nThe above provides a brief overview of essential knowledge about science. Now that you understand the main ideas, let us address the most significant issue: the connection between Buddhism and Science. Significant, but it will be brief because, as we have said, it is merely a provisional means. Naturally, we should not criticize science when we have faith and understand causality, seeing that science in itself has no faults. We should not rely on minor details to force Buddhism into science because as science advances, these aspects will continually change. However, we may take scientific discoveries to bring listeners closer to Buddhism. For instance, when the Buddha speaks of the nature of the four great elements pervading the Dharma realm, someone knowledgeable in science would not be surprised; or when saying this body is not us, those who know science will easily accept. Nonetheless, these are aspects to use sparingly, as frequent use can easily lead to errors when we are not truly knowledgeable in both Buddhism and science. Each term and principle in science has a definite meaning, and without clarity, it is easy to misunderstand.\\n\\nHence, when teaching the Dharma and mentioning science, I believe fellow practitioners should speak from a general perspective, relying on the common characteristics as discussed above.\\n\\nWhat is most noteworthy is that science, like Buddhism, values truth highly, regardless of whether that truth is agreeable or not, or whether it contradicts our familiar understanding. To the scientist, humans are merely phenomena among many, with no prejudice about ranking between humans and animals when seeking knowledge. Buddhism is the same. Buddhism considers humans as merely sentient beings, and this world is just one among countless, infinite worlds. Because it does not regard existing prejudices of humans, science helps us consider the unimaginable aspects of Buddhism. Accustomed to the rigorous discipline of science, not hastily judging, accepting, or rejecting until\\n\\ncalmly hearing Buddhist principles,\\n\\nexamining carefully, we shall\\n\\nnot let its contradiction with our learning\\n\\nlead to hastily dismissing or criticizing it.\", align=None), Span(aid='p:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:28', page=28, vi='', en='Only those who seek the path in this way, with earnestness but not overly rash or misguided enthusiasm, can understand and believe in Buddhism. If we are knowledgeable in science, when hearing Buddhism say life is suffering, or that humans must undergo rebirth, we will not react like those who are sentimental or prejudiced, quickly deeming it pessimistic or illogical. Saying so, with very illogical reasoning: \"If life is suffering, then it’s easy to become disillusioned with life, if there is rebirth, how could we become oxen or dogs?\" please, fellow practitioners, remember\\n\\nto encompass\\n\\nIn fundamental principles\\n\\nare foundational principles, not detailed minutiae. Science\\n\\nrelies on the law of causality to explore the laws connecting phenomena in the universe. Buddhism is the same. Generally and broadly, Buddhism says if there is cause, there is effect. But saying effect is simply talking about a general aspect concerning the life of sentient beings. If precisely stated, it should be called dependent origination. And in the dependent origination of the nature of the Dharma realm, is there a Dharma that doesn’t relate to another? Therefore, speaking of causality is but a small part of a grand universal principle encompassing the universe. Thus, causality in that sense is only relative, only partially true, not absolutely true. Science also acknowledges this. The laws they create are only true within a certain scope, as the phenomena they observe cannot be isolated at will. There are countless influences affecting the phenomena they observe, which they must ignore, countless experimental errors they cannot avoid. This notion of relativity in science can bring us closer to understanding Buddhism, because within the wondrous function of the true mind, all Dharmas manifest. Is there any Dharma that is independently established, any Dharma that doesn’t relate to all other Dharmas?\\n\\nEven though material phenomena are relative, with myriad forms and shapes, scientists still intend to find a common connection for all those phenomena, aiming towards the objective truth as defined earlier. Thus, they dissect matter to the utmost, and today, theory and experiment have proven that matter and energy consist of the subtlest particles, electrons or photons (électron, photon). The matter we see, even light, heat, and electricity we use, all share a common foundation. Although the connection is somewhat temporary, we can say: this helps us acknowledge the Buddhist concept that all Dharmas are one true mind.\\n\\nIn the book \"Buddhism for Beginners,\" we have shown that the method of scientific inquiry resembles the practice methods of Buddhist practitioners.', align=None), Span(aid='p:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:29', page=29, vi='', en=\"Beginning with discipline: eliminate anything that might hinder or obstruct our observation. Next is concentration: focus on the task without letting the mind stray from the subject under study. Finally, wisdom: through concentration, one discovers a principle, illuminating the phenomenon, connecting disparate results into a harmonious system (see the section on Buddhism and science in Basic Buddhism).\\n\\nTo conclude these comparisons, I think we should draw attention to a connection that I consider the most significant. Science represents a particular state of the human mind's desire to know, to know clearly, to know to the extreme, even if it means conflicting with nature, even if it means enduring bitterness and suffering. For that knowledge has revealed to us the humble position of humanity in the universe. The overly developed knowledge that focuses on material objects, with an objective perspective, has caused many superior minds to feel the need to balance it with some emotion, some faith, some compassion. Then, from one extreme to the other — as often happens, many people tend toward emotion and turn to criticize reason, praising religious faith while condemning science. But religions that focus only on emotion, only advocating love, fall into the pitfall of making people easily superstitious, and because of superstition and ignorance, they harm people under the guise of compassion. This is not surprising. Religious wars are proof of the harmfulness of such bias. Buddhism cannot, because Buddhism encompasses both compassion and wisdom. Love but know why we love, how to truly love. Wisdom and compassion always go hand in hand in Buddhism, regardless of the level or method of practice. The benefit of science for us Buddhists may be to demonstrate the importance of understanding so that we can further clarify the importance of wisdom in Buddhism.\\n\\nViên Đình\\n\\nVietnamese Buddhism\", align=None)], author='Viên Đình', summary='This article examines the relationship between Buddhism and science, highlighting how both disciplines seek truth and understanding through observation and analysis.', keywords=['Buddhism', 'science', 'truth', 'understanding']), Section(sid='s:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:the-eternal-light', title_vi='Ánh sáng bất diệt', title_en='The Eternal Light', spans=[Span(aid='p:phat-giao-viet-nam-1956-03:30', page=30, vi='', en='The ascetic years had passed. One day, unexpectedly, the Prince felt weary. He looked back at his body and saw himself emaciated: His body was thin and frail, merely skin wrapped over bones. The strong force of his spirit had sustained his body to some extent, but because of his intense focus on practice, he had neglected to nourish his physical form.\\n\\nFormerly, he had opposed the ascetics. Now he had unintentionally followed their path. So, he stood up and went to the riverbank of the Nairanjana.\\n\\nHowever, being too weak, he collapsed under a tree. A shepherdess passing by saw him and quickly ran over to offer him a bowl of milk.\\n\\nHe received it and felt invigorated; all his noble signs reappeared as before. The shepherdess, astonished, thought he was a deity and knelt at a distance with folded hands in reverence.\\n\\nHe gestured for the shepherdess to come closer and pour him a second bowl of milk. The shepherdess remained bowed.\\n\\n“Please, my Lord, you are a divine being, and I am but a humble Brahmin. I dare not approach you.”\\n\\nThe gentle Prince replied, “Do not be afraid, come here and pour me another cup. I am no divine being, just an ordinary person. I do not differentiate between my noble lineage and your Brahmin lineage. You are a person, just like me. There cannot be a class division separating one person from another, nor can there be distinctions of noble and humble among those who share the same blood.”\\n\\nThe shepherdess joyfully came closer and poured milk for him.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, the villagers near the forest heard of this, and at noon, they brought milk, honey, and other food offerings. He accepted them equally, nourishing his body to restore the balance and harmony between body and spirit, then resumed his contemplation as before.\\n\\nOne day, a servant of Lady Sujata went into the forest and, passing by, saw Him sitting majestically under a tree glowing with radiant light. Astonished, he hurried back to report to his mistress.\\n\\nLady Sujata, upon hearing this, immediately recognized it as a good omen, indicating that the one sitting under the tree was near enlightenment. She ordered her servants to prepare a golden bowl with fragrant milk and personally offered it.\\n\\nUpon nearing him, seeing the radiant light emanating from the Prince\\'s face, Lady Sujata was filled with awe and knelt down, saying:\\n\\n\"I have come to offer milk in this golden bowl, may you be pleased to accept it.\"\\n\\nWithout daring to look, she reverently placed the golden bowl before the Prince and returned home, her heart elated.\\n\\nAfter the prince finished his repast, he took the golden bowl and walked towards the Nairanjana River. He tossed the golden bowl into the river, saying:\\n\\n\"If I am to attain Buddhahood, then this golden bowl must float on the surface and flow upstream against the current.\"\\n\\nAs soon as he spoke, the golden bowl rose to the surface and swiftly floated against the current.\\n\\nThe prince entered the river to bathe. He emerged with a refreshed spirit. A voice within seemed to encourage him, saying that just a little more effort to overcome the final difficult passage would lead him to enlightenment.\\n\\nA young shepherd passed by, carrying four bundles of grass on his back. Seeing the Prince, the boy felt a surge of joy within. He placed the four bundles of grass and his sickle on the ground, bowed with folded hands, and said:\\n\\n\"I have nothing but a sickle and four bundles of grass, I don\\'t know what to offer you.\"\\n\\nThe gentle Prince replied, \"If you wish, you may offer me one of those young bundles of grass.\"\\n\\nThe boy happily placed a bundle of grass in the Prince\\'s hands and saluted him.\\n\\nThe Prince took the bundle, spread its contents beneath a large bodhi tree, its lush green leaves providing shade over a wide area.\\n\\nGazing at the blue sky, the green mountains, then at the bodhi tree, and down at the grass mat he had just laid out, the Prince declared:\\n\\n\"Though my flesh and bones may waste away, though my body may be exhausted, I shall not leave this Bodhi tree until I have found the Way.\"\\n\\nWith that, he calmly sat down in the lotus position, crossing his legs.\\n\\nThat night was the seventh night of the lunar month. Although the crescent moon had just risen and set by the second watch, the thousands of stars were unusually bright.\\n\\nThe Prince was immersed in deep meditation.\\n\\nThe power of his concentration shone with a radiant halo lighting up the Bodhi seat.\\n\\nThe world trembled with vibrations heralding the Moment of Enlightenment. Mara, the Evil One, realizing that defeat was imminent due to the radiant light of Enlightenment, hurried to the Bodhi tree.\\n\\n\"You there,\" Mara said, pointing at the Prince, \"how much light do you have that you dare to aspire to illuminate the path for humanity?\"\\n\\nTurning away, Mara showed the Prince the pitch-black four corners of the sky, with all the stars obscured by clouds.\\n\\nThe Prince did not respond. A beam of light from his forehead swept away all the clouds, and the sky returned to its clear state, with stars twinkling brightly.\\n\\nMara angrily shouted, \"What do you intend to do with your light?\"\\n\\n\"I will use the light of my Way to guide sentient beings, leading all creatures out of the darkness of ignorance to liberation.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, liberation for all beings!

In the first year of Emperor Thieu Tri, it was renamed Tu Dam Pagoda (as inscribed on the sign at the Ancestral House).\\nThe pagoda was established by Venerable Minh-Hoang Tu Dung. He was a native of Guangdong, China, invited by Venerable Nguyen Thieu under the order of Lord Nguyen Phuc Trang (1687-1691), also known as Lord Anh Ton, to come to Vietnam. After transmitting precepts to the Sangha at Linh Mu Pagoda with Venerables Thach Liem, Minh-Vat, Minh Hai, etc., he stayed in Hue to cultivate and teach. He belonged to the third generation of the Lam Te lineage.\\nHe was a person of both virtue and talent. He transmitted the Dharma and certified Venerable Lieu Quan, a Vietnamese, who became the first Zen patriarch in Central and Southern Vietnam.\\n\\nVII. Its Historical Role\\nTu Dam Pagoda not only serves as a place of worship and study for Buddhist followers but also plays a significant role in the evolutionary history of the Vietnamese nation.\\nIn the era of the Northern and Southern conflicts, Hue was a new land: all political and religious sectors were still in their infancy, and the majority of the population, newly emigrated from the North, along with a number of assimilated Cham people, lacked a stable place to establish their livelihoods and a true spiritual belief for their mental life.\\nThis pagoda, along with Venerable Tu Dung, as well as Quoc An Pagoda with Venerable Nguyen Thieu, Linh Mu Pagoda with Venerable Thach Liem, etc., accomplished these tasks.\\nThrough numerous changes: the pagoda was repaired many times, old people passed on, and new ones succeeded; the venerables Thuc Vinh, Sat Ngu, Dao Trung, Thanh Dong, etc., continued this sacred mission.\\nBy 1936, the pagoda was entrusted by the Buddhist Congregation to the Buddhist Studies Association to serve as a center for spreading the Dharma.
