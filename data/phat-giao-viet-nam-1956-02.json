It is a moment of pause in our journey through the pages of the\n\"Journal of Vietnamese Buddhism.\"\n\nIn the tradition of Vietnamese Buddhism, the blank page is not a void, but a space filled\nwith potential. It invites us to be present, to breathe, and to find peace in the\nsimplicity of being. Let this page be a gentle reminder of the power of stillness and\nthe wisdom that arises from within.\n\nFrom ancient times, humanity has been engaged in a struggle. Due to a karmic affinity\nfrom time immemorial, humans possess a physical body existing in a universe, amidst a\nhuman society, alongside countless other sentient beings. Having life means preserving\nlife, whether through consciousness or instinct.\n\nHeat, cold, wind, rain, hunger, cold, wild beasts, disasters... all these are challenges\nhumans need to overcome to survive. Nature is an enemy, but also a friend. When we are\nweak, nature threatens; when we are clever, nature serves. With two hands and a mind,\nhumans have exploited nature, utilized nature, and compelled nature to provide the\nnecessities of life.\n\nFrom the economic lifestyle of gathering to the economic lifestyle of herding and\ncultivation, humanity has truly advanced. But from the beginning, the object of struggle\nwas not only nature and wild beasts. Humans have consumed each other like beasts\ndevouring humans; thus, from ancient times, people have sought ways to cope with their\nfellow beings.\n\nFive or seven individuals banded together, using the strength of unity to protect one\nanother. Tribes were formed, and thus, the struggle against nature became more\neffective. The tribal system marked a step forward for humanity on the path of survival.\nThese human groups developed laws, customs, rituals, entertainment, and unique survival\nmethods. They had culture.\n\nFrom the tribal organization, humanity gradually moved toward the organization of\nnations. During this period, intellect expanded, and the consciousness of kinship\nswiftly developed. The phenomenon of humans eating humans did not frequently occur\nanymore: now, humans directed all their mental and physical energies towards exploiting\nnature.\n\nYet the more nature was exploited, the more resources and food it provided.\nSimultaneously, technological advancements occurred: the scope of exploitation and\nproduction expanded at an unimaginable pace. Economic issues suddenly became critical.\nConflicts erupted between nations and between social classes. War broke out fiercely.\nScience and technology turned to serve war, producing bombs, bullets, and weaponry.\nWhile struggling against nature, humans turned their weapons against each other.\n\nPeople died, blood spilled, flesh torn. In the past, with limited means of production and\ncrude tools, humanity did not die in such numbers as now. All human greed and anger have\nbeen awakened; people have used many malicious schemes to confront one another. Killing\nfellow humans? Never mind. As long as it serves the class, satisfies personal desires.\nPeople kill under the guise of ideals: killing to eliminate disease, to build peace. To\ncounteract killings, naturally, the opposing side must also resort to killing...\n\nIn the past, a black savage eating a white person was called barbaric. Today, a nation\nwith bombs that can kill more people than any other is called civilized. In truth, this\nis nothing more than a horrific barbarity.\n\nPreviously, the direction of culture was a struggle against nature. Now, the direction of\nculture is a struggle against fellow humans.\n\nIn a field of fierce and vast struggle, using harm to prevent harm is an illusion that\ncannot be achieved. The law of cause and effect never errs: sow the wind and reap the\nstorm, plant corn and harvest corn, plant beans and receive beans, and if one sows harm,\nthey will endure the consequences of harm.\n\nHumans must be conscious of this crucial point and must acknowledge that culture has lost\nits way.\n\nPeople need to see that desires of greed and anger have caused chaos in the world and\nmust return to themselves to initiate a great purification within their inner realm.\nThey must be aware that they contain elements of wisdom and compassion, but also\nelements of delusion and desire.\n\nDelusional desires have obscured compassion and wisdom: humans must strive to eliminate\nthem, to nurture wisdom and compassion. With wisdom and compassion, humans can attain\nhappiness and can unite deeply to create a beautiful shared life.\n\nIn the past, culture shifted from struggling with nature to struggling with fellow\nhumans. The direction of the new culture of humanity must be a struggle with personal\ndesires.\n\nThe issue of the value of human beings is a crucial issue for existence. As long as this\nissue is not resolved, people cannot find peace of mind to establish their destiny.\nSolving this problem allows humans to have a firm standpoint and a decisive attitude\ntowards their own liberation.\n\nWhat is the value of human beings and what can they do with all their inherent abilities?\nThe element that determines all aspects of life lies within humans or somewhere else?\nThese are fundamental questions. People can achieve peace and happiness, everyone\nbelieves so and wants to believe so. But how to achieve it? What means to use, and where\nto place trust?\n\nSince ancient times, humanity has lived under the threats of nature. Frightened by\nphenomena like water, fire, and lightning, humans have long submitted to supernatural\nforces they believe lurk everywhere. Offering prayers to wish for blessings and avoid\ndisasters represents complete submission: humans placed themselves under the protection\nof ghosts and deities, feeling that all their successes and failures are decided by\nthese divine beings. If the deities are pleased, then success ensues; if angered, then\nruin follows. Thus, the thought of bribery emerged, and people thought that just some\nofferings could win the favor of the deities.\n\nOnce everything in life is acknowledged as decided by deities, humans must always live in\nfear, not daring to make any decisions on their own. Therefore, divination arises,\nseeking the guidance of divine beings. Here, the value of humans is truly minimal.\n\nAs intellect developed, humanity, through philosophical reasoning, arrived at a more\nrefined concept of belief. Polytheism gradually gave way to monotheism, and instead of\nbelieving in mixed forces, people turned to believe in a single omnipotent, omniscient\ndivine being who arranges all matters in life. Those who receive the favor of this\ndivine being will have happiness and be liberated from suffering. Here, humans no longer\nengage in the ridiculous bribery of the past and have learned about the necessary\nvirtues. However, their minds are still placed in a distant world, and when they seek\nthe divine, they fully believe that only the divine they pray to can bestow blessings\nand save them from suffering. The value of humans here is not much higher. If everything\nis arranged by the divine, then humans, with a mind and two hands, hold no significant\nposition in life.\n\nThe day science emerged, humanity shifted its trust somewhat. People no longer looked up\nto the heavens with hope but placed their trust in the fairy of science, which was\nunveiling marvelous wonders. Many were ready to deny all else, only to hope and trust in\nscience. But as science advanced, so did technology; once Western societies mechanized,\nEastern societies followed. The issues of production and consumption gave rise to\noverall competition. Humans became somewhat mechanical when living in a mechanized\nsociety; economic competition sparked wars. Wars demand weapons, and science was\nimmediately driven to produce killing tools. The birth of the atomic bomb is a\nterrifying threat.\n\nThe latest scientific inventions today are being applied to the act of killing. Science\nhas become a perilous double-edged sword. It is a monster nurtured by humans, now\nthreatening them. Just one small mistake, and humans could be annihilated by it.\n\nAbandoning science is madness because science can serve humanity effectively. But placing\nfaith in it as one would in divine power is a grave mistake. Science is only a product\nof a mind guided by dark desires. Excessive faith in it means humans have forgotten\nthemselves, that is, have denied all the beautiful values they inherently possess.\n\nAlongside those who blindly trust in science, there are those who blindly trust in\nprinciples and organizations. In today's society, people have beautiful principles to\nbroadly ensure rights and freedom. Humans boast of having complete, rational\norganizations. However, no matter how many beautiful principles and organizations exist,\nhumans still do not see any progress on the path to happiness. People rely on having\nbeautiful principles and organizations and think that applying them will lead to\nsuccess. No! Reality has proven that principles and organizations alone are not\nsufficient. To implement them, there must be humans worthy of being called humans. A\nconstitution alone cannot guarantee the future of a nation! To ensure the implementation\nof that constitution, there must be worthy parliaments with talent and virtue. Here,\nhumans are forgotten, and the true value of humans has been diminished.\n\nTrusting in principles or organizations is not much different from trusting in lifeless\nmaterial. Moreover, people are sometimes easily deceived by words and language. After\nthe great wars, charters and declarations spread everywhere. Freedom, equality,\nliberation, happiness, independence... so many beautiful words like the dawn on the\nhorizon were put forth. Every great nation in the world wants to be a leader, a\nbenefactor, a savior of humanity. But in the end, those \"nominal but unreal\" farces\ngradually sow doubt among the masses, and, in the words of a certain writer, all the\nleaflets and banners released with beautiful words ultimately fail to mend the deep\nwounds that history has called bewilderment.\n\nAll the suffering of humanity, in fact, stems from misplaced beliefs. From belief in\ndeities to belief in science, principles, organizations, and beautiful words, humans\nhave indeed somewhat denied their value. Humans have forgotten themselves to seek\nhappiness in forces outside of themselves.\n\nAll the successes and failures of humans must be created by humans themselves. Humans\ndetermine their fate.\n\nThe individual is fully responsible for self-liberation. Whether society is good or life\nis happy depends on the individual.\n\nIndeed, human beings possess the highest value. Yet for a long time, people have\nneglected this. People are not nurtured, cultivated, or trained. While humans become\nincreasingly corrupt, they still believe that skilled hands can build happiness with\nthose tools.\n\nThe status and value of humans have indeed become clear. If we do not rely on values\noutside of humanity, we must recognize this value and act accordingly. Conscious of\ntheir value and role, individuals must strive to self-train, transform themselves, and\nfind happiness through their own actions. Whenever relying on external forces fails,\nhumans have believed that the crucial issue is to hone tools. But now, the tools are\nsharp, and people fear their own creations, claiming that tools have become too\nsophisticated. Thus, it is time to cultivate virtues, so that when individuals become\ngood, society and the universe will also become good. The outward and true aspects of\nkarma are two dimensions of karmic result; recognizing human value is essential to\ntrusting in the professional ability of everyone to create.\n\nTraining individuals is the most urgent task of our era.\n\nBorn into a bureaucratic family, Nguyễn Công Trứ had to endure days of poverty and\ndarkness. His father, Đức Ngạn Hầu, led the Cần Vương uprising against the Tây Sơn.\nAfter King Lê Chiêu Thống fled to China, the movement disbanded, and Đức Ngạn Hầu\nreturned to his hometown in disillusionment, living a mundane life as a village scholar.\nConsequently, Nguyễn Công Trứ, following his father, experienced poverty throughout his\nyouth.\n\nHowever, this impoverished circumstance did not discourage Nguyễn Công Trứ. He strove to\nrise above it, to create a remarkable career. In the struggle with reality, this\nConfucian scholar endured many hardships, but ultimately, he overcame his circumstances\nand succeeded brilliantly.\n\nMany other scholars, like Cao Bá Quát, Trần Tế Xương, and others, tasted bitter failures\nin their careers. But Nguyễn Công Trứ succeeded. We must ask what factor determined this\nsuccess?\n\nPoverty brought Nguyễn many hardships. The image of this poverty is vividly depicted in\nhis poem \"Hàn Nho Phong Vị Phú\":\n\nThis truly is a scene of desolation! The circumstances of a knowledgeable scholar are\nindeed moving, yet the situation of \"destitution and adversity\" of Nguyễn Công Trứ makes\nus deeply understand his bitter toil:\n\nDue to poverty, Nguyễn Công Trứ had to devise various strategies and sometimes even\nconsidered becoming a geomancer or doctor to make ends meet. But as a scholar harboring\ndreams of social status and fame, proud of his exceptional character and morality, he\nultimately did not resort to those desperate means, and returned to daily deprivation:\n\nHowever, Nguyễn Công Trứ's poverty was not like any other poverty. Because\npsychologically, Nguyễn Công Trứ was acutely aware of his poverty. More than anyone, he\nknew he was a \"gentleman,\" a \"hero\":\n\nYet after many exams, the scholarly debt remained unpaid! Nonetheless, Nguyễn Công Trứ\nwas not discouraged. He consoled himself that fame did not need to be rushed; if one has\na body, one must have a name, and if the body exists, fame will eventually follow.\nOccasionally, he felt melancholic over delayed recognition, but this did not dampen his\nspirit.\n\nCao Bá Quát and Trần Tế Xương later found themselves in similar situations, but lacking\nfirm awareness of timing, they failed to maintain their resolve. Cao, after many exam\nfailures, became pessimistic and disheartened. These continuous failures darkened Cao Bá\nQuát's soul, and being a person full of emotions, he allowed sorrow to dominate his\nspirit. The hardships made him suffer, discontent arose, and finally, his obstinate and\nangry temperament led to failure. Trần Tế Xương also struggled with exams and craved\nfame as much as anyone. He lived through poverty like Nguyễn, but being quick-tempered\nand easily discouraged, he angrily mocked others. Mr. Tú Vị-Xuyên truly lacked the\ndemeanor of a true scholar. Observe his petty annoyance when envying those who passed\nthe exams:\n\nYet, he did not stop there! He mocked those who passed the exams, satirized the\nexaminers. All because he failed! If he had passed, perhaps he would not have mocked\nthem like that! Nguyễn Công Trứ was quite different. Despite poverty, hardship, and many\nfailures, he maintained the necessary demeanor of a true scholar. Admittedly, social\ncustoms were not beautiful; wealth was valued, and righteousness was scorned, yet he\ncarefully upheld his character:\n\nAnd because of this, often the gentleman and the hero must feign ignorance, play deaf and\ndumb to endure the hardship. How pitiable for the scholar:\n\nIt was only poverty! But the suffering did not end there: added to the misery of poverty\nwas the suffering of human relations. Nguyễn Công Trứ lamented that in life, only money\nmattered. All flaws and failures stemmed from a lack of money. With money, one could buy\nthe affection of the world:\n\nTruly bitter and disappointing. Pride was sometimes heavily wounded, and character often\nhad to be lowered: those were moments when Nguyễn Công Trứ had to humble himself to\nplease the coarse rich, always knowing only money:\n\nSo often Nguyễn Công Trứ got frustrated and bitterly cursed his poverty:\n\nHowever, this frustration did not drive Nguyễn Công Trứ to recklessness. Poverty did not\nweaken his will; on the contrary, it forged his resolve to become more enduring. In his\nheart, Nguyễn Công Trứ always longed to rise and achieve a remarkable career. What that\ncareer was, even he was not clearly aware of at first. Nguyễn Công Trứ initially only\nwished to pass the exams. Passing would mean escaping poverty and having the means to\nbenefit the country and the people. How to benefit the country and the people would be\nfigured out later; for now, passing was enough.\n\nThus, the career that Nguyễn Công Trứ dreamed of achieving was primarily fame. He devoted\nall his attention to the exams. Amid poverty, he patiently hoped for the day his name\nwould adorn the golden list:\n\nAfter many failures, people often trust in fate. Nguyễn Công Trứ also believed in fate,\nbut here fate was not a harsh destiny. Being a hero means that fate is not to remain in\npoverty forever. A gentleman is born to assist the country and its people; if not yet\nprominent, it's because the time has not come, and any hero must endure poverty first:\n\nIn addition to this belief, there was faith in the cycle of things. Life does not always\nremain the same; everything changes, moving from hardship to prosperity, from\nflourishing to decline. Nguyễn Công Trứ did not believe he would remain in this state of\nhardship forever. Believing in the cycle, he never fell into pessimism because hope\nremained alive in his heart:\n\nThus, Nguyễn Công Trứ patiently awaited:\n\nThe \"time\" Nguyễn Công Trứ considered was not some sacred, metaphysical factor, but the\ntime that determines success. Why hadn't he passed? Because the time had not come. So,\nwhat is \"time\"? Certainly, he did not consider it the period when heaven and earth had\nyet to allow him to pass. No! \"Time\" was merely the shadow of change. If not this exam,\nthen the next, or the one after that. Exams have failures and successes, that is\nnatural. Nguyễn Công Trứ believed as we Buddhists believe in karma. Everything stems\nfrom humans; humans create and receive, with no divine intervention in human affairs.\n\nBelieving this, Nguyễn Công Trứ lived a life of purity and simplicity. He did not become\nreckless like Cao Bá Quát, nor did he become irritable and lose his scholarly demeanor\nlike Trần Tế Xương. Nguyễn Công Trứ remained calm, content to follow the way, waiting\nfor misfortune to turn to fortune. He knew well that \"full stomach becomes Buddha, empty\nstomach becomes ghost,\" but he was determined not to...\n\nTo those of lesser character, patience in maintaining the path is key, knowing that\nsteadfastness will inevitably lead to success.\n\nIn conversations with descendants about the past, he often recited the phrase \"joy in the\nway of poverty\". In discussions with brothers about worldly affairs, he would quote \"to\nbe human is not to be wealthy\". Yet Nguyễn Công Trứ truly succeeded: At the age of 42,\nhe passed the regional examination, was appointed to various positions including\nHistorical Records Officer, and was eventually promoted to Minister of War. His modern\nfame allowed him to help the country and its people, quelling uprisings and helping\nreclaim tens of thousands of acres of arable land, establishing prosperous areas such as\nKim Sơn and Tiền Hải.\n\nAll these grand achievements were possible due to his intense faith in himself. Nguyễn Du\nembraced lonely loyalty, entrusting everything to the heavens, surrendering his fate.\nCao Bá Quát placed too much trust in strategy, unable to endure trials of integrity,\ndisregarding virtue. Trần Tế Xương, after many failures, blamed society and people,\nasserting that his failure was due to a corrupt society, not realizing he himself lacked\nthe conditions for success. Only Nguyễn Công Trứ held firm belief in the law of cause\nand effect, and in his own strength. This faith was the most crucial element in his\nsuccess. This is what Nguyễn Du, Cao Bá Quát, and Trần Tế Xương lacked. Success or\nfailure here was not due to divine or social factors, but a psychological one. Believing\nin one's abilities and in karma's law, Nguyễn Công Trứ achieved success. Thanks to this\nbelief, he avoided falling into pessimism, maintained his demeanor, and preserved his\ncharacter. Beautiful causes lead to beautiful effects; a noble life of virtue and\ncontinuous effort naturally led Nguyễn Công Trứ to the highest levels of success.\n\nBuddhism is a religion founded over twenty centuries ago. The foundation of its doctrine\nis not just one or two scriptures but a vast treasure trove of rich texts. This\nabundance has only increased over time. The earliest works required extensive research.\n\nBuddhist literature is the study of the entire corpus of Buddhist texts across eras and\nsects. Here, we do not claim the grand endeavor that is beyond the capacity of a few\nindividuals. We only present, according to our shallow understanding, the general\nfeatures of Vietnamese Buddhist literature. If our work helps readers gain a general\nunderstanding of Buddhist literature, we are satisfied. First, we present the content of\nBuddhist literature, then its history and teachings, introducing significant works, and\nproviding an overview of its doctrinal systems. Finally, we dedicate a chapter to\nVietnamese Buddhist works across various dynasties.\n\nNext to the Bodhi Society is a Tibetan temple, built by Tibetan monks. Currently, there\nare Chinese monks practicing Tantric Buddhism living there. Beside the temple, there is\na guesthouse for visitors to stay.\n\nBy the roadside, behind a plot of land with a stupa, there is a Chinese nunnery known as\n\"Chung-Hoa Great Enlightenment Temple,\" built by a Chinese nun. The couplets in front of\nthe temple are:\n\nThe Great Vehicle transports the three wheels, universally saving sentient beings beyond\neons\nAll propagate the wondrous Dharma, the Vajra stupa revives the bridge.\n\nThis temple venerates a stone Buddha statue over a meter tall. This stone statue was\ndiscovered when people were digging a trench in front of the temple, and the residing\nnun brought it in to be painted and worshipped.\n\nFor a long time, I have desired to visit the Nairanjana River of our Buddhist followers.\nThe sacred river where, in the past, the Buddha, after using milk, placed his bowl,\nwhich floated upstream; the historical river that once washed away the dust from the\nBuddha's body before he sat under the Bodhi tree to attain enlightenment.\n\nHere it is, the historical river appearing before my eyes. Along the road to the Bodhi\nstupa, about 100 meters from the white sandy bank, the river flows sluggishly. The river\nis very shallow now, and people can cross without needing a boat, just by rolling up\ntheir pants. The scenery here is very simple. The river is shallow. Crossing the river\nneeds no boat. Looking at the river, I feel my heart at ease. Just that is enough to\nfulfill my wish!\n\nAfter visiting the Bodhi stupa, we returned to the residence of the Buddhist monks at\nDien-Dien. We briefly inquired about the current state of Buddhism in Dien-Dien. The\nmonks informed us that the government of Dien-Dien is very devotedly supporting Buddhism\nin both spiritual and material aspects.\n\nThere are about 80,000 monks, an estimated 10 million followers, and approximately 4,000\ntemples in Dien-Dien.\n\nThe monks practice meditation from the time they receive Sa-di ordination until they\nreach the age of twenty.\n\n(To be continued)\n\nBUDDHISM\nand\nSCIENCE\n\n(Continued)\n\nMathematical formulas often accompany measurements, always containing some degree of\nuncertainty. When measuring a table, for instance, I might say the table is one meter\nlong with a relative error of 1/100, meaning it could be between 0.99m and 1.01m, but I\ncan never know its exact length. The more precise the measurements, the more\ncomprehensive the laws discovered can encompass various phenomena. Today, science can\nmeasure with a relative error of one part in ten million for length and even more\naccurately for weight, which allows for the exploration of subtle phenomena, paving the\nway to a rich understanding of quantum concepts.\n\nBased on measurements, science has a very distinct scope. It only examines phenomena\nwithin the realm of sensory verification, whether direct or indirect. For instance, to\nobserve invisible rays, scientists find a way to make them visible on photographic paper\nor chemical plates. Beyond this scope, a scientist does not concern themselves. This\nstatement is not meant to criticize their perspective as narrow but to clearly\ndistinguish what Science is. Furthermore, this scope is already vast, and even a small\npart of it can occupy the minds of a generation. Once this scope has been thoroughly\nexplored, how can one help but be moved to consider issues beyond it? For even\nscientists are human, with questions about the mysterious essence of life. Therefore, it\nis no surprise that science has become the foundation for profound philosophies that\nrequire more than just reading popular books; indeed, one must study some advanced\nmathematics and physics.\n\nThese philosophies not only apply new scientific discoveries but also largely rely on\nthe unique characteristics of science. I would like to sequentially highlight a few key\ncharacteristics to conveniently explain the connections in the final section.\n\nVI\n\n(To be continued)\n\n31\n\nWe arrive here\nAmidst a vibrant spring,\nThe heart of the world feels anew,\nJoy rises in the heart of the twentieth century.\nThe mountain peaks tremble, a child opens a smile,\nA heart filled with bliss,\nWalking with mother to the pagoda to worship Buddha,\nOffering a bouquet of fresh roses,\nThe gray robes flutter above the waves of people.\n\nA genuine heart\n\nWrapped in an old robe.\n\nLaughter echoes amidst the days of toil.\n\nSimple meals, stale broth.\n\nToday, a day of offering to the Buddha, the heart finds peace.\n\nA pure heart,\n\nCalmly witnessing the world’s fluctuations.\n\nHere, the temple provides warmth,\n\nHere, distant from the fires of war,\n\nHere, all grievances fade away,\n\nOh, how beautiful, dear neighbors!\n\nOh, great Compassionate Father of humanity!\n\nHere, the heart warms gently,\n\nThe pain dries and eases...\n\nVitality awakens within the blood,\n\nThe century joyously speaks but stutters.\n\nRich and poor share the same pillow,\n\nEndless joy, the light of the Dharma spreads far and wide.\n\nHere and there, the season of the Dharma rises,\n\nPeople feel the connection already!\n\nBright eyes, a graceful smile,\n\nAnd here, a new spring blooms freshly.\n\n33\n\nDear Chu Tam-Kien,\n\nI have been in Saigon for five days now, and only today have I found the time to write to\nyou. The delay is because I was busy arranging accommodation and finding a school.\nEverything is settled now, uncle. I am currently staying with a friend in Dakao. This\nfriend studied in Hue before, attending the same class as me. His name is Hien, and he\nhas a very amiable nature. Initially, I planned to go to An-Quang temple and ask Master\nMinh-Tue for help finding a place, but I happened to meet Hien on the street. When Hien\nlearned I was looking for lodging, he immediately invited me to his home and asked his\nparents if I could stay there happily. Hien's parents were very welcoming and insisted I\nstay. I was hesitant, but Hien assured me that I could pay for my stay, so there was no\nneed to worry.\n\nThus, I have a place to stay and a good friend. As for school, Hien helped me find one.\nIt turned out that Hien is also in his second year, like me, and advised me to attend\nthe same school as him. I audited classes for two days and found the professors to be\nexcellent, so I officially enrolled. The school is Phuong-Duc, right in the city's\ncenter.\n\nYesterday was Sunday, so I visited An Quang temple but could not meet Master Minh Tue. I\nheard he was busy teaching the Dharma to the Buddhist family at Phuoc-Hoa temple. I\nasked a novice monk to show me around the temple. It turns out this is a Buddhist\nschool, uncle.\n\nAccording to the novice monk, this temple was built in 1949. Being in the city, it does\nnot have the almost absolute tranquility I found in the temples in Hue. Here, I found\nmany familiar things: the gentle demeanor of the monks, the friendly and kind smiles of\nthe young monks, the soothing atmosphere filled with the faint scent of incense...\nPreviously, I thought that leaving Hue meant I could no longer experience the serene,\nmystical hours under the beloved roofs of Bao Quoc and Tu Dam temples. Here, I realized\nthat throughout Vietnam, everywhere is illuminated by the light of Compassion, and\ngenuine Buddhists can create a peaceful atmosphere to live under the Compassionate\nBuddha’s shadow.\n\nAs I mentioned, An Quang temple is also a Buddhist school, like Bao Quoc temple. Thus,\nthere are three Buddhist schools in Vietnam: Hue, Nhatrang, and Saigon. I heard that in\nthe South, there are two other Buddhist schools: Van Thu Buddhist Institute, managed by\nthe Northern Buddhist Congregation, and Giac-Nguyen Buddhist School, supervised by\nVenerable Hanh Tru. On a free day, I will visit those places, uncle, and I will tell you\nabout them later.\n\nNow, let me continue talking about An-Quang temple, the Buddhist school of Southern\nVietnam.\n\nWhen I first entered the temple gate, I immediately felt joyful and recognized many\nfamiliar features. The front hall resembled Tu Dam temple exactly, and surprisingly,\nthere were still the same couplets from Tu Dam temple that one day, standing before the\ntemple gate, you explained to me:\n\n* The Buddha's true teaching governs, with infinite life, infinite light, infinite\nvirtues,\n\n« Study the true meaning, listen truly, think truly, practice truly *\n\nI wandered to the guest house and there, I was received by the Abbot for almost half an\nhour. Afterward, the Abbot asked a novice monk to show me around the temple. To the\nright of the main hall is a long building with two classrooms, filled with young monks.\nOutside, many bicycles were parked, and I learned that besides the resident students at\nthe Buddhist institute, many monks from other temples also come here to study.\n\nThe third-year class was having a lesson on Buddhist philosophy. Some senior monk whose\nname I do not know was teaching on the Mahayana doctrines. Standing outside, I\neavesdropped for about five minutes. The teacher's voice was clear yet gentle, and I\nwanted to listen indefinitely if not for the novice monk by my side. Passing by the\nsecond-year class, I encountered a literature lesson; the young monks were studying the\n\"Chinh - phu - ngam,\" uncle. Thus, besides Buddhist philosophy, the young monks also\nstudy common subjects like literature, science, history... I also like this because I\nbelieve the young monks should have fundamental knowledge in all fields. I was taken to\nvisit the monks' quarters. It was a long, spacious building, with monks’ desks lined up\nin two straight rows. Each monk had a large compartment for tools and books. Each monk\nhad their own bed, coat rack, and desk. The arrangement was neat and orderly; I imagined\nthat even secular dormitories might not be better.\n\nI visited the distribution room for scriptures and read through the catalog. One day, I\nwill acquire some books to send to you. This distribution room is a room on the left\nside of the ancestral house. It seems the ancestral house was recently completed; it has\ntwo floors. The upper floor is the library and the quarters for the senior monks and\nteachers. The ground floor is for worship, the office of the Director monk, and behind\nit are the quarters for the monks and bhikkhus.\n\nI asked permission to visit the main hall and pay respects to the Buddha. The main hall\nwas impressively solemn! The statue of Buddha Shakyamuni amazed me immensely. I had\nnever seen such a beautiful statue. His face was calm, full of compassion and wisdom.\nHis sitting posture was strong and majestic. A statue that embodies all three virtues:\ncompassion, wisdom, and courage is truly rare. I heard this statue was created by a\nlayperson who had taken the Bodhisattva vows, who is currently a professor of painting\nand sculpture at the art school.\n\nIt is said that Buddhism has not yet achieved complete unification. I wonder if this is\ntrue. Personally, when I first encountered Southern Buddhism, I found it not difficult\nat all. Sitting in Ân-Quang Pagoda, talking with a student monk, I felt as if I were\nsitting within the great family of Buddhists. Besides the six Buddhist organizations of\nthe Sect Association, there are many other groups. But I think in such a gentle and\nsincere atmosphere, the groups can surely understand each other and stand side by side\nto build a unified Vietnamese Buddhism, steering clear of all divisive plots from those\noutside the path.\n\nThe letter has become lengthy, so I shall stop here. Wishing you joy and strength, I look\nforward to writing a longer letter next time.\n\nYour student, TÂM TUỆ\n\nHolding a dish of salt, dipping ginger, Ginger spicy, salt salty, please do not\nforsake each other. North and South share one sorrow, Love each other, how\ncould we part? Day and night, one steadfast heart, Remember the vow between\nyou and me: \"When a fish gives birth atop a banyan tree, A bird gives birth\nunderwater, then I'll leave you. When lettuce builds a pavilion, Ironwood\nsliced thin, then you'll leave me.\" To unite as one family, Together build\nour path for eternity. Compassion, remember these words, Follow the wisdom,\ncultivate body and mind. Eradicate greed, anger, arrogance, Love each other\nwith one thought, deep and lasting. Cleverly respond to outsiders, Chickens\nfrom one mother should not endlessly fight. Thanks to the miraculous grace of\nthe Buddha, We build a lasting life forevermore.\n\nFor reasons beyond our control, the article on Tu Dam Pagoda must be postponed to the\nnext issue; we ask for the readers' understanding.\n\n(Continued from the previous issue)\n\nThe soldier holds a bottle of wine. He doesn't seem very drunk yet. He quietly suggests:\n\nThe Soldier:\n\"Grapes into fine wine, in a goblet bright,\nTo drink with the pipa, on horseback take flight...\"\n\n(approaches the beggar and the madman)\n\nHey, you fellows,\nMove along quickly,\nThe officer is about to visit the market,\nDo you know that?\n\n(looks at the madman approaching him, laughs)\n\nAh, a madman!\n\nThe Madman: \"I beg you for a smile, A gentle glance, a soft touch of the lips...\"\n\nThe Soldier: (lashes out with a whip) \"Here's a gentle glance, And here's a soft\ntouch of the lips!\"\n\n(the madman laughs, then runs away. The soldier turns to the beggar)\n\nAnd you, old man,\nWhat do you have to say?\n\nThe Beggar: \"Please, sir and madam, as you pass by, Have mercy on an old blind\nman, writhing in pain, A broken body in distress, Hoping to be reborn as a horse or ox\nto repay kindness...\"\n\nThe Soldier: A broken body in distress, Who cares? Hoping to be reborn as a horse\nor ox. Who minds? Move along, Move quickly, won't you?\n\n(lashes out with a whip again. The beggar runs away, stumbling in fear)\n\n(To be continued)\n\nWORLD BUDDHIST CONFERENCE FOURTH SESSION: The General Association of Vietnamese\nBuddhism has just received an invitation from the organizing committee of the Fourth\nWorld Buddhist Conference. This conference will be held in Nepal (northern India) from\nthe 7th to the 14th of November, 1956. During the meeting on September 1, 1956, the\nCentral Executive Committee of the General Association of Vietnamese Buddhism appointed\nits delegates.
